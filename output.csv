SoftBank 'pauses' productionBy Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Published8 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionPepper was one of the most high profile robots, making appearances at events around the worldPepper, the friendly little humanoid robot that was launched to much fanfare back in 2014, looks as if it may be retired - for now at least.Its maker, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, confirmed to the BBC that production had been ""paused for a while"".It would only start making the robot again ""when it is needed"", it said. The firm is also slashing jobs at its global robotics operation in France, according to Reuters.About half of the 330 jobs there will go, it reports.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionAccording to Reuters, only 27,000 units were ever madePepper had gained attention as one of the first humanoid robots able to ""read"" emotions. It was promoted for use as both a home companion and in public places, such as shops and railway stations.But despite some high profile appearances at conferences and events, it never really caught on as a commercial product. According to Reuters, only 27,000 units were ever made.That was due in part to the $1,790 (£1,290) price tag. The 4ft, 62lb robot was mainly used as a research and educational tool for schools, colleges and universities.Some of Pepper's other roles included:appearing before a parliamentary select committee in UK to answer questions about the use of AI in the classroom in 2018in the same year it began work as a customer engagement robot at HSBC's flagship New York branchlast year it was tested in care homes in the UK as a companion robot helped autistic pupils in a school in Somersetcurrently used as a receptionist in several offices around the worldgreeted travellers at an airport in Montrealin July 2020 a group of the robots were used as cheerleaders at a baseball gameRobotics expert Prof Noel Sharkey said he would be ""happy to see an end to it"".""Pepper did a lot to harm genuine robotics research by giving an often false impression of a bright cognitive being that could hold conversations. ""It was mostly remote-controlled with a human conversing through its speakers. Deceiving the public in this way is dangerous and gives the wrong impression of the capabilities of AI in the real world.""Related TopicsRoboticsArtificial intelligenceMore on this storySocially intelligent robot helps autistic pupilsPublished3 days agoRobot 'talks' to MPs about future of AIPublished16 October 2018Top StoriesEthiopian rebels gain more ground in war-torn northTigrayan fighters continue their advance after wresting the regional capital from government forces.Published16 minutes agoWhat could have caused Miami building collapse?Published4 hours agoChinese students 'fear speaking out' in AustraliaPublished6 hours agoFeaturesHow Delta burst Australia's Covid bubbleThe British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in AsiaThe wards battling India's deadly fungus epidemic.

UK firms had been facing making costly alternative plans with EU counterparts to keep data flowing once a post-Brexit transition period expires this month.The agreement also covers data from countries in the wider European Economic Area.Didier Reynders, Commissioner for Justice, said the adequacy agreement was, ""important for smooth trade and the effective fight against crime"".Welcoming the decision, the UK government said it ""plans to promote the free flow of personal data globally and across borders"".""All future decisions will be based on what maximises innovation and keeps up with evolving tech,"" it added.John Foster, CBI director of policy, called the agreement a breakthrough. ""The free flow of data is the bedrock of the modern economy and essential for firms across all sectors,"" he wrote.No deviationThe commission said in a press release that it reached its decision in part because: ""The UK's data protection system continues to be based on the same rules that were applicable when the UK was a member state of the EU.""However, it added that it would ""intervene"" at any point if the UK deviates from the level of protection presently in place.Some UK politicians have recently argued for changes to UK data protection law.A report, commissioned by the prime minister, from The Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform chaired by Sir Iain Duncan Smith, said: ""GDPR is already out of date and needs to be revised for AI and growth sectors if we want to enable innovation in the UK.""The EU excluded from the adequacy agreements transfers of data to be used for ""immigration control"".A recent Court of Appeal ruling found that some UK data rules relating to immigration were incompatible with GDPR.Related TopicsPersonal dataImmigrationEuropean UnionGDPRBrexitMore on this storyUK lost 'significant' access to EU police dataPublished26 MarchPrivacy group targets website 'cookie terror'Published31 MayTop StoriesEthiopian rebels gain more ground in war-torn northTigrayan fighters continue their advance after wresting the regional capital from government forces.Published34 minutes agoWhat could have caused Miami building collapse?Published5 hours agoChinese students 'fear speaking out' in AustraliaPublished6 hours agoFeaturesHow Delta burst Australia's Covid bubbleThe British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in AsiaThe wards battling India's deadly fungus epidemic.

Is Windows 11 the beginning of the end for Skype? - BBC News,"Is Windows 11 the beginning of the end for Skype? - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechIs Windows 11 the beginning of the end for Skype?By David MolloyTechnology reporterPublished4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionIn 2011, Skype was Microsoft's ""future of communication"" - but not any moreMicrosoft has officially announced Windows 11, its new operating system which will replace the current version over the next few years. Among all the new features are two seemingly small but related things that jumped out.  First - Microsoft Teams, the video-calling app which saw a boom during 2020's pandemic, will be integrated into Windows 11 by default. And second - Skype will not be, for the first time in years.That seems to suggest that Teams is the new favourite child, and many pundits think this is the beginning of the end for what was once the king of calling apps. ""Looks like Microsoft is killing off Skype,"" wrote the Irish & Sunday Independent tech editor Adrian Weckler. ""Bye bye Skype,"" added Future Publishing's content director Jeremy Kaplan. ""RIP Skype,"" was the immediate reaction from The Verge's Tom Warren.Yet the reality is that Skype has been losing relevance for a long time.  'The future' Microsoft bought Skype 10 years ago for $8.5bn (£6.1bn). At the time, it was the tech giant's biggest-ever acquisition, and there were questions over whether it was over-paying.  But Microsoft was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users. ""Together we will create the future of real-time communications,"" Microsoft chief Steve Balmer projected. It seemed to work - the app came bundled with every new computer, and user numbers were strong. But by the middle of the decade, internet forums were full of posts asking ""why is Skype so bad?"" and complaining about updates. Many pointed to poor performance and questionable design choices.  At the same time, mobile messaging apps - such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger - were exploding in popularity and started to introduce video calls, one of Skype's main attractions.media captionWATCH: Skype's 2017 update caused a major backlashThe first version of Skype was launched in 2003, and despite frequent updates, it was starting to show its age. Meanwhile, Microsoft was cooking up its business chat app, Teams, based on more modern tech, which launched in 2017.  ""Microsoft has been moving beyond Skype for several years now, with Teams being its strategic voice and video technology for the new era,"" explained Angela Ashenden, an analyst at CCS Insight. Teams for allUnder the hood, she said, Teams actually used Skype's technology for a while. It was designed to compete with business app Slack, as a work tool. But then the pandemic happened. Zoom, previously a little-known business solution, became a household name overnight. And Microsoft Teams was one of only a handful of competitors ready to take it on. ""As Teams' adoption skyrocketed in the last year, this really sealed Skype's status as a legacy technology for Microsoft,"" Ms Ashenden said. That has only been reinforced by the launch of a personal version, which could directly compete with Skype. With that kind of sudden success, it was ""inevitable"" that Teams would be the Windows default, she added. ""The removal of Skype as a pre-installed app helps reinforce Teams as the preferred solution from Microsoft's perspective, emphasising that this is where its investment will be moving forward."" Microsoft unveils Windows 11 Zoom sees more growth after 'unprecedented' 2020Zoom is in everyone's living room - how safe is it?The writing has been on the wall for a while.Last September, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn announced it was bringing video meetings to its chat feature using Teams and not Skype, with Zoom and another popular system, BlueJeans, as other options. In October, senior Microsoft executive Jim Gaynor told CNBC: ""If Skype was going to become bigger, this year was the time for it.""""What happened right now was the perfect storm, the perfect set of circumstances for any online communications product. If you cannot significantly grow and make your product flourish and thrive now, forget about it, you're too late now."" 'The right solution'Skype did see growth during the pandemic - reportedly a 70% jump to about 40 million people a day. But that is still not as big a growth as its competitors. At a time when the entire world needed a calling app, people chose other options. ""There is definitely an argument that the Teams experience is far too complicated for the less-technical non-business user,"" Ms Ashenden said. ""But if Skype was the right solution for that, we certainly would have seen its usage soaring more over the last year, and we didn't.""media captionWATCH: Teams trickery makes video calls more personalInstead, Teams is likely to evolve to make things simpler for personal users -particularly on mobile devices, she added. But Skype is not being killed off entirely - it will continue to be offered as a download in the Microsoft Store for those who want it in Windows 11.  It won't be alone. Alongside the announcement of Skype's relegation to the store, Microsoft also announced that some other much-maligned apps were being downplayed or removed. Its ill-fated Cortana virtual assistant will no longer be pinned to the taskbar; Internet Explorer is disabled by default in favour of the more modern Edge browser; and tools such as OneNote, Paint 3D, and Windows' 3D viewer app are getting the Skype treatment and becoming optional store downloads.

Cookies track users' internet activity and allow digital publishers to target advertising.They are already blocked by a number of Google's rivals, including Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla.But critics say Google's ban forces ad sellers to go direct to the tech giant for this information instead - giving it an unfair advantage.This is because it plans to replace the system with another one of Google's own design, which it claims is better for privacy but still allows marketing. Its proposals are already under investigation by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).The ban had been planned for 2022, and has now been put back until 2023.In a blog, Vinay Goel, privacy engineering director for Google's Chrome browser said: ""It's become clear that time is needed across the ecosystem"" in order to ""get this right"".According to GlobalStats, Chrome has a 65% market share worldwide.Farhad Divecha, founder of digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said the delay was good news for his industry.""We welcome this delay and only hope that Google uses this time to consult with the CMA as well as different parties that will be affected by the changes, including advertisers, agencies, publishers, and ad-tech and tracking solutions providers,"" he said.Google's new privacy proposals are known as the Privacy Sandbox .One of its ideas is the introduction of something called The Federated Learning of Cohorts, or ""Floc"".The idea is that a browser enabled with Floc would collect information about browsing habits and assign users to a group, or ""flock"", with similar browsing histories. Each would share an ID which would indicate their interests to advertisers.This too has faced a lot of criticism, including from the Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF) which described it as ""[Internet] users begin[ning] every interaction with a confession: 'Here's what I've been up to this week, please treat me accordingly'.""Related TopicsAdvertisingGoogleInternet privacyMore on this storyCookies crumbling as Google phases them outPublished15 January 2020Google's browser privacy plan investigated in UKPublished8 JanuaryTop StoriesEthiopian rebels gain more ground in war-torn northTigrayan fighters continue their advance after wresting the regional capital from government forces.Published1 hour agoWhat could have caused Miami building collapse?Published5 hours agoChinese students 'fear speaking out' in AustraliaPublished6 hours agoFeaturesHow Delta burst Australia's Covid bubbleThe British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in AsiaThe wards battling India's deadly fungus epidemic.

Africrypt brothers deny involvement in Bitcoin 'heist' - BBC News,"Africrypt brothers deny involvement in Bitcoin 'heist' - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechAfricrypt brothers deny involvement in Bitcoin 'heist'By Chris VallanceTechnology ReporterPublished4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesA lawyer for two brothers who founded a South African Bitcoin investment firm has told the BBC they categorically deny any involvement in a ""heist"".Africrypt, founded by Raees and Ameer Cajee, ""absconded"" with Bitcoin then valued at about £2.6bn ($3.6bn), according to a complaint to police.A law firm - Hanekom Attorneys - made the complaint in April on behalf of a group of investors.But there is uncertainty over exactly how much crypto-currency is missing.On its now inactive website, Africrypt described itself as ""an investment firm exclusively focused on crypto-currency and blockchain technology"".The company, founded in 2019,  told investors in only a few years it had grown from a one-man operation running out of a bedroom to ""one of Africa's largest and most successful AI trading companies"".Hack claimedOn 13 April, chief operating officer Ameer Cajee wrote to Africrypt clients announcing the firm had halted operations because of a hack. ""Our system, client accounts, client wallets and nodes were all compromised,"" he wrote.The letter advised investors not to pursue the ""legal route"" as that would ""only delay the recovery process"".Some of the investors who lost access to their money are represented by law firm Hanekom Attorneys.The law firm said Bitcoin valued at $3.6bn had been ""dissipated in its entirety"", in a complaint sent to an elite South African police unit, known as the Hawks.The investigation into where the bitcoins went had been hampered by the use of ""various dark web tumblers and mixers"", the law firm wrote.That refers to technologies that can make it harder to trace bitcoins. The law firm said its analysis led it to believe that describing this as a hack was ""misplaced"".Brothers' responseLawyer John Oosthuizen, who represents Raees and Ameer Cajee, told the BBC the brothers ""categorically denied"" they had been involved in a ""heist"" or had absconded with funds.""There is no foundation to the accusation and there's no merit to those accusations,"" he said.""They maintain that it was a hack, and they were fleeced of these assets,"" he added.He declined to confirm the $3.6bn value for the Bitcoin lost, and noted media reports suggesting the value was an overestimate.image copyrightGetty ImagesAsked by the BBC if the brothers had contacted the police after the alleged hack, Mr Oosthuizen said: ""No.""But he added that they were young men aged 18 and 20 with ""very little life experience"". He said the brothers had received death threats and their first reaction was to keep themselves and their families safe.He said his firm was working to prepare a dossier to demonstrate to the authorities that Africrypt had been hacked and the brothers had been the victim of theft.He said Raees and Ameer Cajee would co-operate with any future inquiries by the authorities. But at present they had not been notified of any investigation.Amount heldQuestions have been raised about amount of Bitcoin Africrypt is said to have held.An investor who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity argued that while the losses were considerable they were very much less than the billions that had been reported.An archive of Africrypt's website from Jan 2021 also suggests it was holding less than $3.6bn in assets: ""We manage over $100m across our venture fund and AI-driven trading platform,"" it read.Financial inquiriesThe Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) said, in a press release, that crypto-assets are not regulated  in South Africa ""and consequently the FSCA is not in a position to take any regulatory action"".The press release said Africrypt, ""was offering exceptionally high and unrealistic returns"".The BBC has asked South African police if an investigation is under way but they have not yet responded.Related TopicsCyber-crimeSouth AfricaBitcoinMore on this storyCryptoasset investors warned they may lose the lotPublished11 JanuaryWhy I bought BitcoinPublished8 January 2018Top StoriesEthiopian rebels gain more ground in war-torn northTigrayan fighters continue their advance after wresting the regional capital from government forces.Published1 hour agoWhat could have caused Miami building collapse?Published5 hours agoChinese students 'fear speaking out' in AustraliaPublished6 hours agoFeaturesHow Delta burst Australia's Covid bubbleThe British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in AsiaThe wards battling India's deadly fungus epidemic.

Dog-owner James Bricknell told the BBC he had repeatedly filled in forms, as requested by Petlog, in order to be reunited with his dog's details but had heard nothing back.Eventually he was told his details were incorrect and he needed to fill in a ""keepership form"". He was asked to pay a £17 fee even though he had updated his details on the website when he changed address.""They suggest it is your fault. They are either dreadfully understaffed or the issue is far worse than they are letting on,"" he said.On various pet-related Facebook groups, the BBC found a host of other complaints including: a cat-owner reporting she went on the site to reregister her pet and found she had acquired a horse a dog-owner saying their dog was no longer registered but a dead cat was on the systempeople who had an account but Petlog no longer had a record of itpeople finding email and passwords not being recognisedreports of people being able to see the details of other pet owners image copyrightGetty ImagesPetlog, which is managed by the Kennel Club, told the BBC: ""Losing a pet is traumatic and we give our absolute assurance that all pets are safely linked to their named owners on our Petlog database, so that they can be safely reunited.""A very small proportion of customers will be unable to immediately view their pet's details after setting up a new online account, as we need to verify their details before making the record visible online, but this is no way affects the information held on our database or our 24/7 reunification line services.""It added that if customers were continuing to have problems, that was probably because the pet was registered under a different name, either that of their spouse, the breeder or rescue centre, or the previous owner.Errors with information provided by whoever microchipped the pet could also mean that ""details are not correct"".And it added:  ""We experienced a couple of rare instances when the system launched a third party implanter inputting on to a pet's record an email address that belonged to another Petlog customer, which resulted in the wrong customer record pulling through. ""We immediately apologised and put in place measures to ensure that the wrong customer record would no longer surface in the event of a similar third party error. We give our reassurance that this in no way affected our ability to reunite the pet and owner in question.

Our databases are all connected, so if a lost pet is scanned, the microchip number is all that is needed to identify it and reunite it with its registered keeper.""We are currently reviewing the microchipping regulations, which will consider if any changes to the way the databases operate are needed, and will publish proposals this year.""Related TopicsMicrochip implantPetsMore on this storyPets detached from owners in database 'cock-up'Published26 MarchTop StoriesEthiopian rebels gain more ground in war-torn northTigrayan fighters continue their advance after wresting the regional capital from government forces.Published1 hour agoWhat could have caused Miami building collapse?Published5 hours agoChinese students 'fear speaking out' in AustraliaPublished6 hours agoFeaturesHow Delta burst Australia's Covid bubbleThe British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in AsiaThe wards battling India's deadly fungus epidemic.

And he hoped to have 500,000 users within 12 months. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionAstronomers worry about light pollution from low Earth-orbit satellitesThe company had two partnerships with ""major country"" telecommunications companies, Mr Musk said.

""It is an arbitrary tax on consumers that is hugely bureaucratic to manage, and with no transparency on how funds are disbursed and spent,"" said a spokeswoman.""Shoppers buying a new phone or laptop might have a lot of questions about why they should have to pay such additional charges, when they already pay a significant amount of VAT."" Those of us who were around in the 1980s will remember the slogan ""Home Taping Is Killing Music"", used by the British record industry in a long-running campaign against what it regarded as piracy, and in favour of a levy on cassette tapes. This latest campaign for a Smart Fund is more subtle, making no mention of piracy, and suggesting that artists, tech companies and government can unite around the idea of a simple one-off levy on gadgets to support the creative industries. ""We're just about the only country in the world that doesn't have some kind of private copying remuneration scheme,"" said one proponent of the idea.With the tech companies not exactly popular and the government keen to find some easy way of helping the arts, the idea may find more political weight behind it this time. But the tech industry will lobby hard to convince ministers that this is just the kind of bureaucratic European scheme that the UK is now free to ignore.View commentsRelated TopicsMobile phonesMore on this storyMPs to investigate how artists are paid for streamsPublished15 October 2020Top StoriesEthiopian rebels gain more ground in war-torn northTigrayan fighters continue their advance after wresting the regional capital from government forces.Published1 hour agoWhat could have caused Miami building collapse?Published5 hours agoChinese students 'fear speaking out' in AustraliaPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow Delta burst Australia's Covid bubbleThe British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in AsiaThe wards battling India's deadly fungus epidemic.

Apple claims 'sideloading' apps is 'serious' security risk - BBC News,"Apple claims 'sideloading' apps is 'serious' security risk - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechApple claims 'sideloading' apps is 'serious' security riskPublished5 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesApple claims that allowing developers to distribute apps outside its official App Store would ""expose users to serious security risks"". A new report from the company argues strongly against allowing so-called sideloading of apps. The report suggests a range of hypothetical problems including ransomware and financial scams. It comes as Apple is under pressure from regulators and some developers over its App Store. The company is awaiting the outcome of its legal battle with Epic Games over what the games studios says are unfair terms set by Apple.  Epic Games has made no secret of its ambition to create a competing storefront - but Apple does not allow third-party app stores to be downloaded from its own App Store. Separately, Apple is under investigation in the EU, UK, and US over its App Store policies, as an increasing number of developers have spoken out against the so-called ""Apple tax"" over the past year. Similar allegations are lodged against Apple's main rival in the space, Google, which is also embroiled in a legal battle with Epic Games. Apple is also concerned that forthcoming EU regulation of digital markets could effectively force Apple to enable sideloading. The 16-page report from Apple appears to be a compilation of all the tech giant's arguments against relinquishing exclusive control of app sales on its iPhone and iPad platforms. Apple charged over 'anti-competitive' app policiesApple investigated over 'unfair' App Store claims""Some have suggested that we should create ways for developers to distribute their apps outside of the App Store, through websites or third-party app stores,"" the report says. ""Allowing sideloading would degrade the security of the iOS platform and expose users to serious security risks."" It also claimed that allowing sideloading ""would expose users to scammers who will exploit apps to mislead users, attack iPhone security features, and violate user privacy"". Accompanying the claims were a series of theoretical scenarios which Apple said showed ""a family's everyday experience"" in ""this more uncertain world"" - accompanied by illustrations of a thieving cartoon fox, apparently representing unscrupulous developers. image copyrightAppleimage captionApple's representation of a pirated app from a third-party storeIt referenced news reports and blogs it said suggested real-world examples of those kinds of activities on Android systems, where sideloading is permitted. The report also touted Apple's app review process - itself controversial among developers - as the primary way to defend users from threats. Some developers took issue with the report, suggesting it was cherry-picking or misrepresenting examples, while others ridiculed the cartoons suggesting the thief could be seen as Apple siphoning off its large cut of sales. ""Is this fox meant to represent the bad guys or Apple taking 30%?"" tweeted developer and blogger Benjamin Mayo. Developers, beware of foxes! They wear masks with dollar signs and take 30% of your revenue. pic.twitter.com/26X4tmTpVZ— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) June 24, 2021

Marco Arment, a well-known developer behind popular apps Overcast and Instapaper, has previously said he is against sideloading on iOS.But reacting to Apple's paper, he wrote that ""the best thing Apple could do to protect the safety and security of iOS touted so heavily in that sideloading PDF [is] lift the most anticompetitive [in-app purchases] rules"".""Without them, no government would have enough reason to force larger changes like sideloading or alternative app stores.""Related TopicsAppleAppsMore on this storyApple charged over 'anti-competitive' app policiesPublished30 AprilApple investigated over 'unfair' App Store claimsPublished4 MarchEpic v Apple: What have we learned?Published24 MayTop StoriesEthiopian rebels gain more ground in war-torn northTigrayan fighters continue their advance after wresting the regional capital from government forces.Published1 hour agoWhat could have caused Miami building collapse?Published6 hours agoChinese students 'fear speaking out' in AustraliaPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow Delta burst Australia's Covid bubbleThe British law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in AsiaThe wards battling India's deadly fungus epidemic.

The new software will let Android apps run on the Windows desktop.Product manager Panos Panay promised smaller, faster security updates - a common complaint for Windows users - and said they would happen in the background.Windows 11 will also let users configure multiple desktops for work, home, and gaming, like on a Mac.Microsoft says there are currently about 1.3 billion devices running Windows 10.An early preview version of the new system will be released for app developers next week.Windows 11 will be available as a free update to existing Windows 10 users - although some devices will not have the right specifications. These include a minimum of 64 gigabytes of storage and 4 gigabytes of RAM.One cosmetic change is putting the ""Start"" button at the bottom-centre of the screen rather than left-hand side.image copyrightMicrosoftimage captionThe 'Start' menu is now centre-aligned and available in a dark modeimage copyrightMicrosoftimage captionA new widgets window will provide personalised updatesimage copyrightMicrosoftimage captionMicrosoft Teams chat will be built-inIn addition, Windows 11 will feature tighter integration with Microsoft's communications platform Teams. Xbox Games Pass, a subscription service offering access to hundreds of games, will also be pre-installed.The tech giant said it would share more profits from its app store with creators and developers - as rival Apple continues to face challenges over its business model.When Windows 10 launched in 2015, Microsoft said it would be the final version of the operating system. It has since announced Windows 10 will be retired in 2025.Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella described the launch as ""a major milestone in the history of Windows"", but analyst Geoff Blaber from CCS Insight said he did not consider it to be  ""a revolutionary step"".""Windows 11 is an iterative release that pinpoints where Windows needs greater ambition, rather than introducing the sweeping changes seen with its predecessor,"" he said.""The end game for Microsoft is ensuring that the step up from Windows 10 to Windows 11 provides significant enough improvements to offset any complaints.""Forrester's principal analyst JP Gownder noted that the new operating system was based on the code of Windows 10, which should prevent upgrade glitches such as those seen in the past with Windows Vista.""These user-friendly nods to the past are a double-edged sword, though,"" he added. ""They're great for continuity of experience, but they make you wonder what the 11 really stands for.

Legal to Type"" campaign says if it becomes law, US tech firms would gain too much power.The draft bill places new duties on social media firms to remove harmful or illegal content.The government has said firms should have safeguards to ensure freedom of speech.These would include effective routes for people who have had their content removed to appeal against any decision.The new campaign includes Ruth Smeeth, of Index on Censorship, Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, Gavin Millar QC and MP David Davis.While the group supports the bill's aim of ensuring online platforms remove images of child sexual abuse, terrorist material and content which incites racial hatred and violence, it fears other provisions will adversely affect free speech.The new bill could see legal online posts from ordinary people blocked and would turn Ofcom into a free speech ""super regulator"", it claims.Legal harmsPublished in May 2021 the Draft Online Safety Bill imposes a ""duty of care"" on social media companies, and some other platforms that allow users to share and post material, to remove ""harmful content"".This can include content that is legal but still judged to be harmful, such as abuse that doesn't reach the threshold of criminality, and posts that encourage self-harm and misinformation.Under the bill, Ofcom will be given the power to block access to sites and fine companies which do not protect users from harmful content up to £18m, or 10% of annual global turnover, whichever is the greater.Campaigners claim this gives tech firms an incentive to ""over-censor"", and ""effectively outsources internet policing from the police, courts and Parliament to Silicon Valley"".Government lays out plans to protect users onlinePorn blocker 'missing' from Online Safety Bill prompts concernOnline harms law to let regulator block apps in UKCampaigners are particularly concerned about content that is legal, but deemed to be harmful.Mr Davis described the bill as a ""censor's charter"". He added: ""Lobby groups will be able to push social networks to take down content they view as not politically correct, even though the content is legal.""The bill includes some protections for political speech and journalism, but in a report published simultaneously with the launch of the new campaign, Index on Censorship argued they did not go far enough.""For instance, while news published on the Telegraph's website would be subject to the journalistic exemptions in the bill, the article disseminated on Facebook would be subject to the algorithmic removal of 'legal but harmful' content',"" the report said.Campaigners are also concerned that technology companies may use artificial intelligence to identify harmful content. That, they say, may introduce racial biases and will wrongly censor language, ""especially when it comes to irony-loving Brits"".

Its creator, Prof Stefan Klein, said it could fly about 1,000km (600 miles), at a height of 8,200ft (2,500m), and had clocked up 40 hours in the air so far.It takes two minutes and 15 seconds to transform from car into aircraft.'Very pleasant'The narrow wings fold down along the sides of the car.Prof Klein drove it straight off the runway and into town upon arrival, watched by invited reporters.He described the experience, early on Monday morning, as ""normal"" and ""very pleasant"". In the air, the vehicle reached a cruising speed of 170km/h.It can carry two people, with a combined weight limit of 200kg (31 stone). But unlike drone-taxi prototypes, it cannot take off and land vertically and requires a runway.image copyrightKlein Visionimage copyrightKlein VisionThere are high expectations for the nascent market in flying cars, which have long been heralded in popular culture as a visionary landmark of the future.In 2019, consultant company Morgan Stanley predicted the sector could be worth $1.5trillion (£1tn) by 2040.And at an industry event on Tuesday, Hyundai Motors Europe chief executive Michael Cole called the concept ""part of our future"".It is considered a potential solution to the strain on existing transport infrastructures.'Huge market'The company behind AirCar, Klein Vision, says the prototype has taken about two years to develop and cost ""less than 2m euros"" (£1.7m) in investment.Anton Rajac, an adviser and investor in Klein Vision, said if the company could attract even a small percentage of global airline or taxi sales, it would be hugely successful.""There are about 40,000 orders of aircraft in the United States alone,"" he said.""And if we convert 5% of those, to change the aircraft for the flying car - we have a huge market."" 'Really cool'Dr Stephen Wright, senior research fellow in avionics and aircraft, at the University of the West of England, described the AirCar as ""the lovechild of a Bugatti Veyron and a Cesna 172"".And he did not think the vehicle would be particularly loud or uneconomical in terms of fuel costs, compared with other aircraft.""I have to admit that this looks really cool - but I've got a hundred questions about certification,"" Dr Wright said.""Anyone can make an aeroplane but the trick is making one that flies and flies and flies for the thick end of a million hours, with a person on board, without having an incident.""I can't wait to see the piece of paper that says this is safe to fly and safe to sell.""Related TopicsAir travelEngineeringMore on this story'Flying Lamborghini' lift-off delayedPublished27 MayDegree in 'flying car' engineeringPublished24 January 2018'Flying car' concept on showPublished12 July 2018United plans supersonic passenger flights by 2029Published5 JuneTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published42 minutes agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished5 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The final years of John McAfee's controversial life - BBC News,"The final years of John McAfee's controversial life - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechThe final years of John McAfee's controversial lifeBy James ClaytonNorth America technology reporterPublished5 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightReutersimage captionMcAfee founded an anti-virus company of the same name, in 1987In 2012, the game appeared to be up for John McAfee. After going on the run in Belize, he had been arrested in Guatemala after his neighbour was found dead. The police described him as a ""person of interest"" in the case. However, as in many situations in his life, he somehow managed to wiggle free. McAfee shot to fame in the 1980s, after launching an anti-virus software company he named after himself.His success brought with it money - but throughout his life, McAfee seemed almost as good at losing money as he was at generating it. In 2008, he had moved to Belize, where he ended up living next to man called Gregory Faull. In November, 2012, Faull was murdered in his home. ""The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him,"" McAfee told the BBC's Leo Kelion.image copyrightReutersimage captionGregory Faull was found shot dead at his home in BelizeBut their relationship apparently broke down over dogs McAfee believed had been poisoned. ""There was no ongoing argument,"" he told BBC News.  ""Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. ""Maybe, as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. ""At the time, I certainly did not believe that.""Free manIn fact, as ABC News later revealed, Faull had filed a complaint about McAfee's dogs - saying one had attacked a tourist. Whatever the truth, when the police came looking for McAfee, he was not around. He was living with a 17-year-old girl at the time and the police discovered a large number of weapons in his home. When they eventually caught up with him, in Guatemala, many believed McAfee would be tried for Faull's murder. But within a week, he was released and allowed to fly to Miami - a free man.""After it was over, I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid?'"" he told BBC News. ""But I really can't remember.""Money-making ideasFaull's murder hung over McAfee for the rest of his life. In 2019, a Florida court ordered him pay $25m (£18m) to Faull's estate in a wrongful death claim.However, on his return to America, he characteristically went about pursuing new money-making ideas - settling in Lexington, Tennessee.In 2016, McAfee announced he wished to run as a presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party. He campaigned to end the ""war on drugs"" and bulk up US defences against cyber-security attacks from China and Russia. But he was unsuccessful.  Better luckAround this time, McAfee started to promote crypto-currencies. And at first, he appeared to have better luck in his business ventures than his political career. He used his public platform to promote so-called alt-coins - crypto-currencies set up as rivals to Bitcoin.And in 2018, The Verge reported he was charging $105,000 per tweet to promote initial coin offerings. He also threw his weight behind an ""unhackable"" crypto-wallet - which was then hacked.But the way he was promoting crypto-currencies would later draw the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).image copyrightMcAfeeimage captionJohn McAfee played up to his bad-boy reputation - claiming to have 47 childrenCertainly according to the filings of Tennessee prosecutors, McAfee appeared to be doing well financially. And in October 2020, he was arrested in Spain as he was about to board a plane to Turkey.  He was accused of failing to file tax returns for four years, despite earning millions from consulting work, speaking engagements, crypto-currencies and selling the rights to his life story.Prosecutors believed McAfee owed $4,214,105 in taxes between 2014 to 2018, the Associated Press news agency reported.And the US Justice Department alleged he had evaded tax liability by having his income paid into bank accounts and crypto-currency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.He was also accused of concealing assets, including a yacht and real-estate property, also in other people's names.'Go dark'While in prison in Spain, McAfee was indicted on further changes. The SEC accused him of fraud and money laundering over his use of social media to promote crypto-currencies. He later told his Twitter followers he planned to ""go dark"" on social media after receiving ""threats"" from the SEC. The US government had ulterior motives in requesting his extradition, he said, and his attempt to run as a Libertarian Party candidate was a factor.But on Wednesday, Spain's National Court found there was ""no revealing evidence"" he was being prosecuted for political or ideological reasons and authorised his extradition back to the US.  Dark twistsMcAfee believed if he was extradited he would spend the rest of his life behind bars. Within hours, he was found dead in his cell. And his lawyer said he had killed himself. Although he never fitted the mould of a Silicon Valley tech founder, his anti-virus company was hugely successful. But he was also a complex and erratic man - whose colourful life was pockmarked with dark twists and acts of self-destruction. And his final years were defined by characteristic exuberance and a nihilistic contempt for authority.

The first was a high-resolution scan of the original, and the second a painted copy - made before the trimming - by Gerrit Lundens, which is displayed in London’s National Gallery.Rather than hiring a painter for the reconstruction, the art was created pixel-by-pixel in Rembrandt’s style, using the scanned photos as a reference for the details and colours used in the original.“Our attempt here is to make a best guess, without the hand of an artist, into what The Night Watch looked like,” Robert Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum, said.image copyrightRijksmuseum/Reinier Gerritsenimage captionThe new sides are being displayed next to the original trimmed paintingThe images were then printed and mounted at the sides of the original painting - so visitors can imagine the full canvas, as intended by the artist.Museum visitors will now be able to see changes including:Three figures on the left-hand side (two men and a boy)A complete helmet on the right side of the paintingA clearer view of a boy in the left foreground, running away from the militiaRepositioning of the painting's composition, so its figures are in different places“Looking at the concept of the composition, all of a sudden it becomes clear how [Rembrandt] - almost as a dance director or a performer - tries to grab our eyes and move the eye through the composition, up to the central piece being the captain, together with his lieutenant,” Pieter Roelofs, head of paintings and sculptures at the museum, said. “So both movement and dynamics gained enormous equality, and that helps us … get a better understanding of the original intentions, both of the artist, and of this painting as a concept.”The original Night Watch was a commission by Amsterdam’s civic guard for their clubhouse in Amsterdam.After trimming it to fit in the city hall years later, the painting now lives at the Rijksmuseum. The restored scans will be displayed for three months as part of a temporary exhibition, or can be viewed on the museum’s website.

""There are, however, many other aspects which need to be taken into account, which, due to lack of data, may not be amenable to AI approaches.""But the predictions would be ""particularly valuable"" for pathogens with unknown protein structures, including some neglected diseases.""Developing new AI approaches for designing such drugs is a new challenge but one to which the new AI techniques can be applied and this holds out great hope for the future,"" Dame Janet added.Free accessDeepMind has been criticised in recent years, after data from its health division was being transferred to its parent company, Google.And as a result, some partners withdrew from its Streams app, which helps doctors and nurses in some NHS hospitals monitor patients with kidney conditions.But last year, the AI program was used to map some Sars-Cov-2 virus proteins. And virologists used this information to better understand how the virus behaved.DeepMind will also be publishing a peer-reviewed paper detailing the workings of its system, providing free access to AlphaFold for the scientific community.

Legal to Type"" campaign says if it becomes law, US tech firms would gain too much power.The draft bill places new duties on social media firms to remove harmful or illegal content.The government has said firms should have safeguards to ensure freedom of speech.These would include effective routes for people who have had their content removed to appeal against any decision.The new campaign includes Ruth Smeeth, of Index on Censorship, Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, Gavin Millar QC and MP David Davis.While the group supports the bill's aim of ensuring online platforms remove images of child sexual abuse, terrorist material and content which incites racial hatred and violence, it fears other provisions will adversely affect free speech.The new bill could see legal online posts from ordinary people blocked and would turn Ofcom into a free speech ""super regulator"", it claims.Legal harmsPublished in May 2021 the Draft Online Safety Bill imposes a ""duty of care"" on social media companies, and some other platforms that allow users to share and post material, to remove ""harmful content"".This can include content that is legal but still judged to be harmful, such as abuse that doesn't reach the threshold of criminality, and posts that encourage self-harm and misinformation.Under the bill, Ofcom will be given the power to block access to sites and fine companies which do not protect users from harmful content up to £18m, or 10% of annual global turnover, whichever is the greater.Campaigners claim this gives tech firms an incentive to ""over-censor"", and ""effectively outsources internet policing from the police, courts and Parliament to Silicon Valley"".Government lays out plans to protect users onlinePorn blocker 'missing' from Online Safety Bill prompts concernOnline harms law to let regulator block apps in UKCampaigners are particularly concerned about content that is legal, but deemed to be harmful.Mr Davis described the bill as a ""censor's charter"". He added: ""Lobby groups will be able to push social networks to take down content they view as not politically correct, even though the content is legal.""The bill includes some protections for political speech and journalism, but in a report published simultaneously with the launch of the new campaign, Index on Censorship argued they did not go far enough.""For instance, while news published on the Telegraph's website would be subject to the journalistic exemptions in the bill, the article disseminated on Facebook would be subject to the algorithmic removal of 'legal but harmful' content',"" the report said.Campaigners are also concerned that technology companies may use artificial intelligence to identify harmful content. That, they say, may introduce racial biases and will wrongly censor language, ""especially when it comes to irony-loving Brits"".

A complaint was lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) over the Go-Vi Eradicator 19. The company behind it claimed its purifier was ""proven to destroy coronavirus cells"". The ASA said the purifier's claims were misleading and could not be substantiated. It is one of many similar products sold around the world during the pandemic with supposed benefits to detect or prevent infection by Covid-19.The advert appeared on a website called ""protect-nhs"" which was run by the company, and not affiliated with the actual NHS. The small print claimed the £570 device was more than 99.9% effective at destroying the H5N1 bird flu virus, according to testing done in France. But the ASA said the average reader would be led to believe it was similarly effective against Covid-19. Go-Vi Ltd, based in Worthing, disputed the ASA's challenge, telling the watchdog the product was effective at destroying the Covid-19 virus.How clean is the air in your office? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoorsThe company claimed it had been tested by independent labs and provided reports it said supported its claim. It also said it was ""no longer promoting the product"" and the website had been pulled down ""as a result of a change in their business model"". The ad watchdog, however, decided to uphold the complaint. Real-world settingsThe device worked by pulling air into the unit and using ozone gas and ultraviolet light to clean the air. The ASA said that ""in principle"" the particular type of ultraviolet light was effective against the Covid-19 virus - but real-world testing was needed.After consulting the Health and Safety Executive, the ASA said the effectiveness of such air cleaners depended on many related factors. But ""the performance of most devices was based on data measured in idealised controlled environments and was likely to be different and often lower in a real-world setting"", it said in its ruling.  Guidance published by the government's Sage scientific advisory group had also suggested that air cleaning devices ""had limited benefit"" in places that already had adequate ventilation. media captionLockdown easing: The BBC’s science editor David Shukman explains the risks and what to watch for in different locations.Sage ""discouraged the use of air purifiers unless there was strong evidence of their efficacy"", the ASA said.  It also looked at guidance from the European Chemicals Agency on how to determine the effectiveness of a product, which recommended a barrage of tests including in real-world scenarios. ""We therefore expected to see methodologically sound evidence that reflected how the product was likely to be used in real life,"" the ASA said. ""It did not consider the conditions of realistic use, such as the amount of air flow depending on the type of space where the air purifier was placed, the variable settings likely to be applied to the air purifier, the type of the space where the air was being disinfected, or relevant soiling and interfering substances."" The evidence submitted by the firm was not adequate proof that the product could destroy the virus, either on surfaces or in the air, or that it was better than any other method of ventilation, the ASA found.As a result, it was found to have broken two rules, one on misleading advertising and one on substantiating claims. Go-Vi could not be reached for additional comment.

""Google collects data to be used for targeted advertising purposes, it sells advertising space and also acts as an online advertising intermediary.""A level playing field is of the essence for everyone in the supply chain.

It comes days after Facebook announced it would place adverts inside players' headsets, starting with shooter game Blaston. It was the only named title listed to take part.But its maker, Resolution Games, has now said its game ""isn't the best fit"" for in-game advertising. After an outcry from gamers, the company issued a statement to media outlets from chief executive Tommy Palm, saying it had seen the feedback. ""Some good points have been made, and we realise that Blaston isn't the best fit for this type of advertising test. Therefore, we no longer plan to implement the test in Blaston,"" he said. After listening to player feedback, we realize that Blaston isn’t the best fit for this type of advertising test. Therefore, we no longer plan to implement the test. We look forward to seeing you in the arena and hope you try the Crackdown Update that went live today!— Blaston (@BlastonGame) June 21, 2021
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterBut he added that it might move the test to one of its other games - a free fishing title called Bait! - in the future. He said that ""if ads in VR become inevitable as [they have] on other platforms, we want to ensure we... do it right"". Facebook has previously said a couple of other developers will be involved in the test and revealed in the next few weeks.'Selling out'  The backlash to the initial announcement was swift. Blaston was quickly ""review bombed"" in online stores - both Oculus's own store and PC gaming store Steam. Angry gamers accused the company of ""selling out to Facebook"" or ""handing the future over to a deranged billionaire and his ad-fuelled dreams"". Others called for refunds. image copyrightFacebookimage captionAn example presented by Facebook of what ads might look like in BlastonThe reaction is part of a continuing debate about Facebook's role in the future of VR, which has been rumbling on for years. Oculus, Facebook's VR wing, started out as a much-admired independent company, widely credited with bringing modern VR gaming into the mainstream.  Its first VR headset was announced in 2012, and managed to crowdfund more than $2.4m (£1.7m). Facebook bought the company for $2bn (£1.4bn) just two years later. Can digital tourism get people travelling again?Virtual reality headsets for work ‘could snowball’Developer warns VR headset damaged eyesightThe sale immediately raised concerns among gamers - including many of its Kickstarter backers - convinced that Facebook would bring some of its business practices as a data-led advertising firm to the gaming platform.  Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey sought to downplay such fears at the time. He wrote in various online posts that Facebook had pledged not to require users to have a Facebook account in order to use Oculus devices - something it brought in last year - and that Oculus would not ""flash ads at you"". He has since posted in online forums to say he genuinely believed the assurances at the time. 'A big opportunity' Facebook's long-term plans have remained a contentious issue among VR gamers. Fans broadly see Facebook's Oculus Quest 2, the most popular VR headset, as good for the industry as a whole.But others believe Facebook is selling its headset far more cheaply than its competitors, such as Valve's Index, in a bid to dominate the market so that it can be used to gather data, like Facebook itself.media captionBespoke training environments can be rapidly createdMany analysts speculate that Facebook is selling the Quest 2 at a loss - or barely above cost - to achieve its market dominance. It now has 30% of the PC VR market, according to Steam statistics. Richard Windsor, an analyst at Radio Free Mobile, said that cost is a ""rounding error"" in Facebook's accounts. ""I think that Facebook will quickly kill these advertising experiments because the last thing it needs to do right now is to enrage its user base just as the momentum is beginning to build,"" he said. ""Facebook has a big opportunity with this platform, and it makes more sense to sit tight and look to monetise it more effectively once it has really established itself as a leader in the VR market.""

Those with drones weighing more than 250 grams must also pass a test on the CAA website.""We've had 200,000 registrations since the system was set up in November 2019 but we think that there are many more out there unregistered, potentially tens of thousands,"" said Jonathan Nicholson, from the CAA.""Our prime concern is about aviation safety and how aircraft and drones can legally share airspace. So the emphasis is on the drone user, because it is much more likely they will see a helicopter or light aircraft, than the pilot of those will see a drone.""He said that the rules for registered, larger drones were ""common sense"" and include:stay well away from aircraft, airports and airfieldsdon't fly closer than 50m (164ft) to people and don't fly over themnever fly over crowdskeep 150m away from built-up areasThose flouting the rules face fines, and anyone endangering aircraft could receive a prison sentence of up to five years.New threatAs well as safety and privacy issues, the police are also concerned about the use of drones for illegal activities such as smuggling drugs into prisons.Police will be on the lookout for drones, amid some high-profile events happening in the UK, including the current Euro 2020 football competition, and the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November.CRISTIANO RONALDO: How one Portuguese footballer became a sporting starIRELAND AFTER PARTITION: Peter Taylor revisits his work over the past 50 yearsRelated TopicsPolicingDronesMore on this storyRoyal Mail trials drone delivery to Isles of ScillyPublished11 MayNew rules for drone users across Europe and UKPublished31 December 2020Top StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published58 minutes agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Worryingly for technology giants, Ms Khan has been one of their most vocal critics. Ms Khan was born in the UK and moved to the US as a child. In an interview with BBC Hardtalk in January, she talked about how she started getting interested in competition law as a policy researcher after graduating.""What became clear is there had been a systemic trend across the US... markets had come to be controlled by a very small number of companies,"" she said.  Gradually her focus began to shift to competition - or rather a perceived lack of competition - in Silicon Valley. Her general criticism is that Big Tech is simply too big - that a handful of large US tech firms dominate the sector, at the expense of competition. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionGoogle's Sundar Pichai was quizzed on anti-trust issues by Congress in July 2020Some of her Democrat colleagues have even suggested that Facebook and Google could be split up. Facebook could be broken off from Instagram, for example, or YouTube cleaved away from Google. Anti-trustThe comparison she uses is from the late 19th Century, when a handful of companies, or ""trusts"", owned key parts of the infrastructure of the US - such as the railroads. ""Anti-trust"" legislation was passed to try to prevent companies holding monopoly power. However, critics like Ms Khan say current laws aren't fit for the competition challenges of today. ""These firms essentially provide infrastructure to the digital age,"" she told the BBC in her previous interview. ""A small group of private executives are setting the rules of who gets to use the infrastructure and on what terms,"" she said. In 2017, Ms Khan wrote a paper called ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox"" for the Yale Law Journal. It argued that the traditional anti-trust focus on price was inadequate to identify potential harms done by Amazon.This is a much-repeated criticism of the laws around antitrust. Traditionally ""monopolistic"" behaviour would result in price increases for consumers. However, that doesn't often happen when it comes to Big Tech. In fact, when it comes to Facebook and Google, their services are mostly free to the consumer, while Amazon will often have lower prices than its competitors. Instead, the argument is much more nuanced. For example, it's argued that these companies are so big, and control so much of the internet, that they can undercut their competitors.Current anti-trust laws don't necessarily reflect that reality, and once again this is something about which Ms Khan has talked. ""Even when services are good for consumers, they can hurt a whole set of other interests - be it workers, be it business formation, be it democracy at large."" she told the BBC. 'Tremendous news'Ms Khan's appointment has been hailed by anti-trust campaigners, and in particular by Democrats. Elizabeth Warren - who supported breaking up Big Tech in her 2020 presidential campaign - described the appointment as ""tremendous news"". And in the FTC, Ms Khan now has teeth to back up her ideas. She has gone from legal activist and academic to holding perhaps the most powerful consumer protection job in the country. The commission is already in the process of suing Facebook for ""illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct"". It is also investigating Amazon.I’m so grateful to the Senate for my confirmation. Congress created the FTC to safeguard fair competition and protect consumers, workers, and honest businesses from unfair & deceptive practices. I look forward to upholding this mission with vigor and serving the American public.— Lina Khan (@linamkhan) June 15, 2021

That there are Democrats and Republicans who support antitrust action makes her position even more powerful. Ms Khan's appointment is the clearest sign yet that President Biden means business when it comes to clipping the wings of companies like Amazon and Apple. These companies, though, have big pockets and good lawyers. Ms Khan may want to take the fight to Big Tech, but she should expect a long, drawn-out legal battle if she is to get her way.

But like iMessage, it will be active only if both users have it turned on and have wi-fi or data.Users will be able to tell because the ""send"" icon will have a small padlock on it.

It warned that the government's target to make Britain gigabit-capable could be derailed unless consumers upgraded.It found that only one in five people was willing to pay more for faster services.It also discovered that many people are unclear about how a gigabit service would differ from their current package.And, despite a slew of advertising around the technology and its benefits, about six in 10 consumers remained unaware of the availability of gigabit services.Reduced fundsOther recommendations from the report included:regulator Ofcom to introduce a ""gigabit-ready"" labelling scheme to increase awareness local authorities to help raise awareness and promote the benefits of upgradingimprove digital skills for small businesses and the self-employedThe government has invested £5bn into helping roll out ultra-fast broadband to remote areas of the country by 2025.But in November, it announced that only £1.2bn of that would be made available over the next four years, leading to confusion over how and when the rest would be available. It also reduced its original aim to reach every home in Britain to 85%.According to Ofcom, one in four homes can now access broadband services offering speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second).It is expected that commercial deployments of gigabit-capable fibre networks will reach more than 70% of premises by the end of 2025 without government intervention.In response to the Gigatag report, the Internet Service Providers' Association urged the government to act on the proposals.""The pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital connectivity more than ever, and while our members are rolling out gigabit-capable networks at pace, it will be equally important to ensure that take-up continues to grow.""Related TopicsBroadbandFederation of Small Businesses (Scotland)CBIMore on this storyMillions offered cheaper fibre broadbandPublished3 MayOne in four UK homes 'can access 1Gbps broadband'Published17 December 2020Top StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Imgspice is based in the Seychelles and allows users to upload images and videos to webpages for sharing with others.Advertising money from popular content is shared with the uploader if they receive enough views. The IWF says the website is known to its hotline operators as a ""notorious"" site used by predators to share child-sexual-abuse material.There were more than 2,500 incidents of confirmed child-sexual-abuse content on the site, last year.And so far this year, investigators have found nearly 1,500 webpages containing child-sexual-abuse material on the site. Most of the images or videos are of 11- to 13-year-old girls.  media captionA BBC investigation has found what appears to be children exposing themselves to strangers on the websiteAn Imgspice representative said it was working to improve its platform moderation and blamed the volume of illegal uploads on a possible jealous rival trying to harm its business.  Imgspice has been hosted by multiple providers in multiple countries since at least as far back as 2014, and in recent years by NForce has hosted it, based in the Netherlands.But on 28 May, Australian authorities started receiving complaints about content found on Imgspice.And investigators warned the IWF the site was now being hosted in the UK.The IWF said it had then found URLs of webpages containing child-sexual-abuse content it had worked to have taken down just days earlier, when the site had still been hosted in the Netherlands.Once the IWF had secured clearance from police, a takedown notice was issued to Zare, which acted on it extremely quickly, and, within 40 minutes, the site moved back to the Netherlands. Previously, the proportion of global child-sexual-abuse material hosted in the UK was 0.1%.'More proactive'IWF chief executive Susie Hargreaves said: ""At the root of all this, someone, somewhere is profiting financially from the rape and sexual abuse of children. ""This is what is at the core of this.""If you have a business hosting content, you need to make sure that you are not facilitating the spread of images and videos of this abuse. ""It's as simple as that. ""Companies need to be far more proactive in keeping their servers clear of this material.""'Working hard'NForce said it was the responsibility of its customers to monitor their own content and it was satisfied Imgspice was working hard to improve its moderation.""IMGspice is not to be blamed here,"" a spokesman said""They can't monitor all the images,.""They are removing them as soon as they get any issues.""And after implementing a new system to identify previously uploaded materials, this is as much as they can do.""

The IAB Tech Lab, based in New York, develops digital ad industry standards.IAB members include Facebook, Google and Amazon.The case brought by Johnny Ryan centres on the data shared between ad brokers and other firms while ad space is being auctioned as a site loads.It's known as real-time bidding.The IAB said it was the first it had heard of the claim, although the court papers are dated 18 May.""We are reviewing the allegations in conjunction with our legal advisers and will respond in due course, if appropriate,"" said a spokeswoman.There is a debate about the volume of data gathered about people in order to target digital ads, although this form of revenue is what currently keeps most internet services free to use.But Mr Ryan argues that most people using online services are not aware of the amount of data that is shared about them, and with whom.As a web page or app that carries advertising is loading, information is shared about the device it is loading on, some details about where that device is, and other information including previous websites visited and their subject matter.  This data is used by brokers to sell the ad space that is on that page in seconds or less, targeting the person using the device - although the person is not named. If you momentarily see empty advertising spaces before they are filled on a web page or an app, you are essentially watching yourself being auctioned in that moment, says Mr Ryan, a former advertising industry professional who is now at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.There may be hundreds of ad firms representing different clients involved, but the brands themselves are not directly a part of the process.The advertising industry says personally identifiable information isn't shared. But critics say the sheer volume of information - even without a name - is still a violation of privacy.image captionThis screenshot, from an app, captures the moment of a real time bid""Every time we load a page on a commercial website or use an app, the website or app tells tens or hundreds of companies all about us, so that their clients can decide whether to bid on the opportunity to show you an ad,"" he says.""These bid requests include inferences of your sexual orientation, religion, what you're reading, watching, and listening to, your location.""The firms can also tell whether they have seen the individual's profile before, Mr Ryan adds.It is a multi-million-dollar industry.The IAB Tech Lab provides industry-standard, two and three-digit codes which represent a huge number of categories - including subject areas like sexuality, religious views and whether the device appears to belong to someone with debts. They are attached to individual profiles.This publicly available code is called audience taxonomy.So, for example, according to the current standards, code number 383 represents someone who has expressed interest somewhere online in hair loss treatments, and number 60 denotes a household with an income of less than $10,000 (£7,000).Mr Ryan has now lodged the case with a court in Hamburg, on the grounds that nobody has actively consented to this data being gathered or shared.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionJohnny Ryan once worked in the digital advertising industryHe says he filed a similar complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner's Office when the European data privacy law GDPR was launched in May 2018 but the investigation is still continuing three years later. Duplicate complaints have been lodged with information commissioners in other EU countries, he said.""The law needs to apply and sweep the industry so you can still have your bid requests but without personal data changing hands,"" he said.Apple is also increasingly cracking down on ad-tracking, enforcing ""opt-in"" consent for being tracked by apps on its devices - with a large majority of its customers choosing not to enable it.Facebook has argued that Apple's move is likely to hit small businesses hardest.Related TopicsData protectionAdvertisingInternet privacyMore on this storyWhy can't Google get a grip on rip-off ads?Published3 MayFacebook v Apple: The ad tracking row heats upPublished26 April'Spy pixels in emails have become endemic'Published17 FebruaryHow coronavirus is changing the adverts you seePublished28 May 2020Top StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

New game footage revealed that the game will involve floating islands, skydiving, and new powers in the same world as its predecessor. But it will not release this year, and is currently pencilled in for a 2022 release date. There was also no reveal of a widely-rumoured ""Switch Pro"" console, which Nintendo has yet to confirm.The Japanese firm had sought to play down reports from several news outlets that the company was set to show off a revised model of the Switch at E3.When it announced the date of its E3 show, it stressed it would be software only. E3 2021: Forza Horizon 5 - is bigger also better?E3 2021 kicks off with Avatar and Mario revealsE3 2021: Halo Infinite, Starfield, and a new ForzaNintendo also ruffled feathers in the streamer community when it clarified early in the day that it was not granting permission for ""co-streaming"" - where gaming personalities can stream the presentation on their own channels with their own commentary.  Nintendo tweeted from their official account that co-streaming today’s event is not allowed, differing from years past. While /twitchgaming has permission to air the show, we won’t be airing the event because all creators can’t co-stream. https://t.co/Cx7kNsIIdJ— Twitch (@Twitch) June 15, 2021
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterSome creators opted to take the copyright risk and do it anyway - while streaming site Twitch boycotted the stream from its own gaming channel in solidarity with disappointed streamers. Nintendo was still able to broadcast the show on its own Twitch channel. Zelda soars skyward (again)Nintendo's presentation was the same pre-recorded video format the company has used in recent years.  And while the trailers for games came thick and fast, many were for smaller or previously announced titles. Expectations had been high for a glimpse of the new Zelda title, as this year marks the franchise's 35th anniversary. The new footage for the next title - a sequel to the 2017 game which was widely reviewed as a masterpiece - came in the last few minutes of the 40-minute show. It showed the existence of floating islands and in-game skydiving, and a new ability which seemed to show the hero Link moving through solid objects as if made of water.   Figure captionWarning: Third party content may contain advertsBut no game title was shown, and no release date beyond 2022. The game was first teased at E3 2019. And apart from a collectable retro Game and Watch, the company said ""we don't have any other campaigns or Switch games planned"" to mark the franchise's 35th year. The previously-announced Legend Of Zelda Skyward Sword HD - a remaster of the 2011 Nintendo Wii game - will still release as planned on 16 July. Metroid with a horror twistBeyond Zelda, Nintendo showcased a handful of other new first-party titles. Metroid is getting a new game - but not the beleaguered Metroid Prime 4, which had to restart development in 2019 after the first studio making it was deemed not up to standard.  Instead of the 3D shooter, fans were shown a new side-scrolling game, Metroid: Dread, which Nintendo said was the first 2D Metroid game in 19 years. Figure captionWarning: Third party content may contain advertsThe title is a nod to the apparently un-killable robot which chases players throughout the game. Nintendo also showed off a new entry in the WarioWare series - the first since 2013's Game & Wario spin-off. WarioWare: Get it Together uses the same party game style as its predecessors, with players competing madcap, nonsensical minigames. But this title will allow two players to play at once in a co-op mode. Many of the other new games shown were Nintendo Switch versions of games already coming to other platforms, such as Square Enix's just-announced Guardians of the Galaxy, or collections and remasters of older titles. But many fans were excited for other titles from the Japanese firm - such as a remastered collection of the classic Advance Wars and Danganronpa games.In closing the show, the hosts said: ""We are diligently continuing development on a number of other games we didn't show today."" Tuesday is the final day of E3, which went online-only for the first time this year, and Nintendo's conference is the last of the largest developers, with Bandai Namco and smaller events closing out the day.Related TopicsE3NintendoGamingTwitchMore on this storyWhat to expect at E3 2021Published11 JuneE3 2021 kicks off with Avatar and Mario revealsPublished12 JuneE3 2021: Forza Horizon 5 - is bigger also better?Published15 JuneE3 2021: Halo Infinite, Starfield, and a new ForzaPublished13 JuneTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Web founder Berners-Lee to auction source code as NFT - BBC News,"Web founder Berners-Lee to auction source code as NFT - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechWeb founder Berners-Lee to auction source code as NFTPublished15 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesThe creator of the world wide web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, is selling off the original code used to create the modern internet as an NFT. NFTs are a form of unique ownership for digital-only items and do not necessarily include copyright control. They have also been widely criticised as a money-making scheme and bad for the environment. Some have expressed surprise at the news given that Sir Tim famously refused to patent his invention.The sale is being handled by Sotheby's auction house, and the money made will be put towards causes chosen by Sir Tim and his wife, Sotheby's said. Sir Tim invented the world wide web - the main modern way we use the internet - in 1989. He proposed a way of linking together different pieces of information stored on the early internet through hyperlinks, and built the first web browser and web server.  The first web page described the idea: ""Aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents."" What are NFTs and why are some worth millions?Buying a pink NFT cat was a nightmare'Signed copy'Sotheby's is auctioning off a collection of four different items as a single digital NFT. They include ""the original time-stamped files"" of the source code written for the project, ""an animated visualisation"" of that code, a letter from Sir Tim about the process, and a ""digital poster"" of the code created by him. In all, the files represent nearly 10,000 lines of written code.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionSir Tim photographed at MIT in March 1998Sir Tim has never sought to make money directly from his creation, and the web remains an open standard. Cern, the research organisation Sir Tim worked for at the time, relinquished all its rights to the technology and put it in the open domain in 1993. The value of the code is arguably in its historical significance, and the fact that this digital auction is endorsed by its creator and ""digitally signed"" as authentic. Sotheby's is advertising the collection as ""the only signed copy of the code for the first web browser in existence"", in a manner similar to the way handwritten journals of a famous figure might be sold. It's likely that this unusual auction will raise a hefty sum for the good causes Sir Tim and Lady Berners-Lee support. Some of the air has gone out of the NFT bubble but the web's source code is just the kind of thing likely to catch the eye of some wealthy fan of all things crypto.Still, for the man who tweeted ""this is for everyone"" about the web at the London Olympics Opening Ceremony and has won huge respect for never having wanted to profit from his creation, this is a somewhat unlikely move.There is plenty of controversy around NFTs - to some they are a brilliant innovation which means digital art and other collectibles can be monetised, to others they're little more than a giant scam which gives gullible - or publicity seeking  - buyers the illusion of ownership.But the biggest question mark is over the environmental impact of NFTs created on the Ethereum blockchain. One analyst puts the carbon footprint of a single Ethereum transaction at more than 14 times that of putting an art print in the post.Concerns about this have seen some digital artists reject NFTs - one described them as ""an ecological nightmare pyramid scheme"".We wanted to raise some of these issues with  Sir Tim Berners-Lee but his office referred all questions to Sotheby's.'It feels right'""Why an NFT? Well, it's a natural thing to do as when you're a computer scientist and when you write code and have been for many years,"" said Sir Tim in press material issued by Sotheby's. ""It feels right to digitally sign my autograph on a completely digital artefact."" media captionDigital-only artwork by Beeple sold for $69m (£50m)And he also drew comparisons between the abstract nature of the web itself and this new idea. ""NFTs, be they artworks or a digital artefact like this, are the latest playful creations in this realm, and the most appropriate means of ownership that exists,"" he continued. ""They are the ideal way to package the origins behind the web.""And the auction house maintains that ""the carbon footprint of this NFT is negligible"" because it will pay for a carbon offset for the minting and transaction costs of the sale - though the blockchain on which the transaction lives has immense day-to-day running costs.Sotheby's said the auction would run from 23-30 June, with an opening bid of $1,000.

Vodafone picks Samsung for 5G network - BBC News,"Vodafone picks Samsung for 5G network - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechVodafone picks Samsung for 5G networkPublished14 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesVodafone UK has chosen Samsung as a supplier for its 5G infrastructure, as it seeks to extend its coverage.One analyst described the move as a ""breakthrough"" for Samsung, in a market expected to be dominated by Ericsson and Nokia, after the UK joined other countries in banning Huawei products.Vodafone says it aims to broaden its range of suppliers.Samsung kit will initially be installed in 2,500 rural sites in the south-west of England and most of Wales.The South Korean firm is one of a number of companies contracted by Vodafone to build what it calls, ""the ""first commercial deployment of Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) in Europe"".The Radio Access Network covers the equipment that provides the final link between your phone and the telephone network, and includes equipment such as mobile phone antennas on towers and buildings. With Open RAN, parts of the network made by different suppliers are designed to work in the same way, meeting a common set of standards.Because equipment from different suppliers is interoperable, the network can be put together using components from a range of companies, rather like Lego, as opposed to being built by a single supplier.Johan Wibergh, Vodafone's chief technology officer, said using Open RAN would allow the company to release new features simultaneously across multiple sites, add capacity more quickly and resolve outages ""instantly"".This feels like a key moment in the UK's 5G story.Ever since the mobile operators were told they were going to have to phase out Huawei's equipment, they've been faced with a very limited choice - either Nokia or Ericsson - for their 5G kit. That, they warned, could mean higher prices and a slower rollout. But now Samsung, which had long been considered to be out of the game in Europe's telecoms equipment market, has made a stunning comeback and broken up the duopoly. Other deals seem likely to follow.This is also a big step forward for the OpenRan concept, which would allow components from different suppliers to be switched out at base stations that, until now, have been kitted out by a single supplier.The UK government - keen to limit the fallout from its Huawei ban - has been pushing the idea in the hope that it would bring more suppliers into the market. But Nokia and Ericsson have already signed multiple 5G deals in the UK and have a big lead, which they will fight aggressively to defend.New contenderIn July 2020, the UK's mobile providers were banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment and told they must remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027.It followed concerns that using the firm's equipment posed a national security threat - something Huawei strongly denied.Analysts saw this as a significant step for Samsung as it seeks to compete with the leading firms in the market.""This partnership represents a major market breakthrough for Samsung,"" analyst Richard Webb, of CCS Insight said.Samsung still had a long way to go to catch up with Ericsson and Nokia, he noted, but should be seen as ""a genuine contender"".Mr Webb added: ""This contract win adds to its credibility, and could be a signal for other European operators to consider Samsung as an option.""He also noted that Open RAN may be helpful to companies like Samsung seeking to challenge dominant players in the market.""Vendor diversity is one of the principal tenets of the concept,"" he said.Related TopicsVodafone5GMobile phonesSamsungMore on this storyVodafone calls for 5G auction to be scrappedPublished16 July 2020'UK faces mobile blackouts if Huawei ban rushed'Published9 July 2020Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027Published14 July 2020Top StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

WhatsApp launches privacy campaign after backlash - BBC News,"WhatsApp launches privacy campaign after backlash - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechWhatsApp launches privacy campaign after backlashBy Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporterPublished14 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightWhatsAppimage captionIn one of the campaign ads, a couple is seen exchanging WhatsApp messages while at dinner with talkative friendsWhatsApp has launched its first major privacy-focused advertising campaign in the UK. It follows a customer backlash against changes to its terms and conditions, announced earlier this year.The platform also said it is standing firm against pressure from governments, including the UK, to compromise on the way that it encrypts messages.Authorities should ""demand more security"" rather than less, WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart told the BBC.""The first step of keeping people safe is, you have to have strong security, and we think governments shouldn't be out there trying to encourage tech companies to offer weak security,"" he said. ""They should be out there trying to encourage or even mandate that companies offer the strongest security possible.""The marketing campaign is set to run internationally, beginning in the UK and Germany on Monday.WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption, which means messages can only be read on the device which sends one and the device which receives it. WhatsApp itself - and by default its parent company Facebook - cannot view or intercept them, and neither can law enforcement.Home Secretary Priti Patel has described the use of end-to-end encryption as ""not acceptable"" in the fight against the sharing of illegal content.In a speech in April said she wanted to see it used ""in a way in which is also consistent with public protection and child safety"" but did not elaborate on how this might work.image copyrightReutersimage captionHome Secretary Priti Patel has expressed concerns about end-to-end encryption enabling child abuseFacebook says it intends to roll out encryption more broadly across its other services.WhatsApp is already blocked in mainland China, and it is suing the Indian government over new digital rules that will force it to violate its privacy protections. Around 400 million of its two billion global users are in India.Mr Cathcart said he ""lives with the reality"" that more countries could also choose to block the platform as tech sector regulations tighten around the world.Fight against illegal contentWhile the firm cannot see the content of messages, it has developed other tools which help it block illegal material and widely-shared misinformation. WhatsApp bans two million accounts every month, and in 2020 the platform reported 300,000 images to the National Centre for Missing Exploited Children, Mr Cathcart said. It does this using a combination of reports from message recipients, and machine-learning using the unencrypted data that WhatsApp can see - such as the volume of messages an account sends and how many groups it joins. Messages that have been forwarded lots of times before are also now flagged, and there are limits on how many people one user can share the same message with.Terms and conditions confusion In January, thousands of users threatened to leave WhatsApp, wrongly thinking it was going to start sharing messaging data with Facebook following an announcement about changes to its terms and conditions.Those who did not accept the update would begin to lose functionality, it said. There were false claims that the privacy of personal messages was about to change, and thousands of  alarmed people flocked to rival services such as Signal and Telegram.In fact the changes are mainly related to enabling companies to accept payments via WhatsApp.Will Cathcart said the firm took responsibility for the ""confusion"" the announcement had created.""To reiterate, nothing about the privacy of people's personal conversations changed in our update,"" he said.Related TopicsFacebookInternet privacyWhatsAppMore on this storyReminders on rise as WhatsApp update deadline loomsPublished14 MayFacebook encryption ‘must not cause children harm’Published19 AprilTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

A new Forza racing game and the Xbox release of Flight Simulator were also among the 30 titles revealed.It was the first E3 since Microsoft acquired Bethesda last year for $7.5bn (£5.3bn). Unlike other developers' conferences, the 90-minute Microsoft show was nearly entirely back-to-back game trailers and announcements, with few speeches in-between. Bethesda boss Todd Howard started the event with news of a November 2022 release date for the firm's first new series in 25 years, Starfield. E3 2021 kicks off with Avatar and Mario revealsWhat to expect at E3 2021The space-faring game was shown only with some in-game footage of a ship taking off from the surface of another world - revealing no new details about what its gameplay would be like. Halo Christmas release Halo: Infinite was officially delayed due to the pandemic.  But a preview released in July 2020 was widely criticised by fans of the game as looking unpolished, with enemy character models labelled as crude and reminiscent of older games, rather than a next-gen title. The developers pledged to work hard on improving them. Sunday's video showed off the series hero Master Chief meeting a new AI character, as the two discussed a mystery around the fate of Cortana, the game's other long-running protagonist. But it notably did not include the alien enemy models which caused so much controversy last year. image copyrightMicrosoftimage captionThe Master Chief will return to gamers' screens later this yearMicrosoft did, however, show off the game's multiplayer mode for the first time - the main attraction for many players.  Sticking to plans to make the multiplayer part of the game a free-to-play package, not requiring a purchase of the main product, Microsoft said it would release it alongside the game for the Christmas shopping season. The company's flagship racing title, Forza Horizon 5, set in Mexico, was also revealed for the first time with a 9 November release date. image copyrightMicrosoftimage captionDevelopers said that some of Mexico's landmarks were faithfully recreated for the new ForzaDevelopers said parts of Mexico's real landscape had been faithfully recreated using photogrammetry data - the same type of 3D technique used by Microsoft's Flight Simulator to map realistic cities. But in Forza's case, it was used for geographic features such as the caldera of a volcano. A new game mode would allow players to create their own challenges - such as a ""bowling alley"" map where players drove through bowling pins and over ramps. Flight Sim gets Top GunAnother impending release was the arrival of Flight Simulator for Xbox consoles on 27 July. The game was first released in August 2020 on PCs, and is notorious for pushing even high-end gaming computers to their limits. image copyrightMicrosoftimage captionAlongside an Xbox release, Flight Simulator will get Top Gun themes fighter jetsA new expansion was also shown off, tied to the Top Gun film series - which will bring official support for fighter-jet style planes for the first time. Previously, such planes have only been available through player mods or paid add-ons.

What is the idea?Several companies have promoted the idea of autonomous ""flying taxis"" that could pick passengers up from rooftops in city centres and take them wherever they would like to go.Virgin Atlantic's suggestion is slightly tamer. It has proposed that an eVTOL aircraft could pick people up from a city such as Cambridge and fly them to a major airport such as London Heathrow.Vertical Aerospace says its VA-X4 craft will be able to carry four passengers and a pilot up to 100 miles, as well as being emissions-free and quieter than a helicopter.In fact the company claims it will be ""near silent"" when cruising.It has already partnered with American Airlines and Avolon, an aircraft-leasing company.Is it feasible?""There's a lot of hype in this market,"" Vertical Aerospace president Michael Cervenka told the BBC.""We have taken the approach that is pushing the bounds of what is available in terms of technology, but not going beyond.""With a 15m (49ft) wingspan, the aircraft would have to fly to and from designated spots such as helipads or regional airports. As with any other aircraft, the VA-X4 will be subjected to strict safety and regulatory checks.Dr Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University, said Slovenia's Pipistrel Velis gave a good indication of what a modern electric plane could achieve.""The Velis will carry two people, half a toothbrush and fly for about an hour-and-a-quarter. That is a conventional aeroplane and thus pretty efficient compared to anything with vertical take-off and landing,"" he explained.While the VA-X4 will be quieter than a helicopter, the ""rotors and wings would still make noise in forward flight"", he added.Mr Cervenka expects it will sound no louder than a refrigerator from the ground, when cruising overhead.He said the company's goals could be achieved with today's technology rather than hoping for the invention of a ""magical new battery"".But more lavish visuals of air taxis carrying passengers from one skyscraper to another would require new air-traffic control technology, public acceptance of more aircraft in cities, improvements in automation and regulatory change that could be a decade away.On Thursday, Vertical Aerospace announced plans for the company to be floated on the New York stock exchange after a merger with Broadstone, in a deal valuing the company at $2.2bn (£1.6bn).Related TopicsBristolVirgin AtlanticAir travelAerospaceTransportMore on this storyUnited plans supersonic passenger flights by 2029Published5 JuneTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

First it got back a large chunk of the Bitcoin paid to the gang behind the Colonial pipeline ransomware attack. Then it led a global operation which saw suspected criminals tricked into using a messaging service operated and monitored by the agency. On this week's Tech Tent, we explore whether criminals will now think twice about using tech in their activities.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC SoundsWhen it comes to understanding and using the latest technology it has often seemed that law enforcement is always at least one step behind the criminals. Not this week.Just how the FBI managed to retrieve $2.3m (£1.6m) of Bitcoin paid to the DarkSide ransomware gang is far from clear. Theories range from the agency having an insider in the gang who handed over the private key to the Bitcoin wallet where the ransom had ended up, to the criminals being careless enough to leave their loot in a well-known exchange which could be ordered to hand it over. Some have even suggested that Colonial only paid the ransom at the behest of the FBI so that the gang could be tracked more effectively.Whatever the truth, Ciaran Martin, who as former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre worked closely with the Americans, thinks life may have been made harder for the criminals. ""There'll be a lot of people now distrusting the payment mechanisms of cryptocurrency,"" he tells the programme. ""And when there starts to be a bit less trust, that's a good thing.""Suddenly the idea that Bitcoin movements can be tracked - something that cryptocurrency experts have been pointing out for years - seems to have become fashionable. ""Pipeline investigation upends idea that Bitcoin is untraceable,"" read a New York Times headline this week. But even when the money has been traced you still need the private key to unlock it and Ciaran Martin warns that the Colonial Pipeline ransom recovery operation may prove a rare success. ""It's so clever and so good, it's quite hard to do it that often,"" he says.""To do it again, requires a lot of very clever operational skill, a lot of resources.""On Wednesday it emerged that another ransomware victim, the meat processing giant JBS, had paid out $11m in cryptocurrency to its attackers. Whether the FBI can mount a recovery operation on behalf of the Brazil-based company remains to be seen.But the operation which saw the FBI and the Australian police fool hundreds of criminals into using a supposedly secure messaging app could prove a bigger blow in the fight against crime.Spotting a gap in the market after two other encrypted services used by criminals were taken down, the FBI appeared to act like an innovative start-up, seeding devices carrying the Anom network with ""key influencers"" in the form of alleged  crime bosses.Now, says Ciaran Martin, seeds of doubt will have been sown in criminal minds.""Any criminal hearing, 'We've got this new gadget that will help us evade the authorities,' will treat it with much more suspicion, even if it actually isn't a law enforcement set-up,"" he said.Law enforcement agencies have had to acquire all sorts of technical skills as crime has moved online. But the huge profits derived from cybercrime mean the criminals too are investing heavily in innovative techniques. The FBI may have had a good week but you can bet the crooks will have their victories in the months ahead.

Mr Zuckerberg set out his own experience of remote working in a separate memo to staff.He said being out of the office had made him ""happier and more productive at work"", adding it had given him ""more space for long-term thinking"" and enabled him to ""spend more time with my family"".Mr Zuckerberg spends some of his time on his private estate in Hawaii.Home daysOther tech giants have also set out their future plans for the return to the office.On Thursday, Amazon told employees they're expected to work in-office at least three days per week, with the specific days to be decided on by leadership teams.  Employees in the UK, US and a handful of other countries are expected to begin their return to the office in early September.In an all-staff memo last week Apple boss Tim Cook said he missed the ""hum of activity"" and workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September, specifying Wednesdays and Fridays as when employees may work remotely.But that plan proved controversial among some employees, who circulated a letter that said Apple's policy had ""already forced some of our colleagues to quit"".In a message to ""Googlers"" in May, chief executive Sundar Pichai wrote that the company would move to a hybrid work week, where most staff would ""spend approximately three days in the office, and two days wherever they work best"".The changes, he wrote, should eventually result in the majority of employees being in the office a few days a week, and about a fifth working remotely full-time.Mr Pichai added: ""The future of work is flexibility.""Related TopicsFacebookFlexible workingMark ZuckerbergMore on this storyApple employees rally against office working planPublished7 JuneIs Big Tech going off remote working?Published6 AprilTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

It counts major series such as Battlefield, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, The Sims, and Titanfall among the titles it develops or publishes - as well as a vast array of annual sports games.'No risk to players'""We are investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen,"" an EA spokesperson said in a statement.""No player data was accessed, and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy,"" she added.The company said it had already improved security and stated that it did not expect ""an impact on our games or our business"".Law enforcement has also been contacted.The ""network intrusion"" was not a ransomware attack and had happened recently, EA added.In its report, Vice said it had seen screenshots of the hacking forums used by the attackers, who are advertising the stolen data for sale.Valuable hackSource code is a version of computer software which is usually much easier to read and understand than the end version in a finished product, and could be used to reverse engineer parts of the product.For example, the Frostbite engine, which hackers claim to have the source code for, is a powerful game creation tool used in dozens of games, from FIFA to the Battlefield series and several recent Star Wars games from EA.The source code for the engine could hold significant value for an unscrupulous developer willing to copy it, or for those making cheat codes and hacks for games.But it is unlikely that any mainstream competitor to EA would ever use such stolen data.It is the latest in a string of high-profile gaming company hacks.In November last year, Capcom, the maker of Street Fighter and Resident Evil, suffered a ransomware attack which may have revealed the personal information of up to 350,000 people.And in February, Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red suffered another ransomware attack which resulted in the source code for several games being stolen and auctioned off online.In that case, the hackers claimed to have sold the data for more than $7m (£4.9m), though it is not clear if the sale actually happened.Related TopicsCyber-securityGamingCompaniesMore on this storyStreet Fighter firm's security beaten by hackersPublished16 November 2020Cyberpunk 2077 makers hit by ransomware hackPublished9 FebruaryTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

It would help them spot signs of:street harassmentdomestic abusemodern slavery and human traffickingcounty lines and drug dealingWill Shu, the founder of Deliveroo, said: ""Riders have carried out a vital role during the pandemic and are well-placed to build on this experience to spot any concerns in the neighbourhoods in which they work and live.""The idea for the scheme came from a delivery rider who became a Neighbourhood Watch coordinator. Part of the course will provide safety and awareness training for riders.Female safetyLast year Deliveroo partnered with the NSPCC to train couriers to spot and report signs of child abuse. More than 7,000 riders completed the training.When the firm went public in April, it was shunned by some investment firms over its record on workers' rights.On the day it listed on the London Stock Exchange, there were strikes across the UK, and demands for the firm to do more to end harassment of its workers. According to the IWGB union, more than eight out of 10 couriers felt unsafe at work and had experienced either verbal or physical assault.Ahmed Hafezi, from the couriers branch of the IWGB, told the BBC: ""Time and time again couriers have reported the inadequacy of Deliveroo's process for supporting workers who've been assaulted on the job. ""Often, when couriers report incidents to Deliveroo and other courier companies, the first question is about the welfare of the package, not the human being delivering it."" He said he was not sure the new scheme was the answer.""The solution to this is definitely not more policing. Couriers, the majority of whom are BAME, are already subject to disproportionate police stops and immigration checks. We know the courier community is safest when it is united, not divided. This project will be divisive.""

Reports claimed the device was due for release in mid-2022 and would feature multiple cameras.But a senior Facebook executive said the smartwatch was in only its early stages - and may never be released to the public.""We're investing in technologies across the board... research doesn't always lead to product development,"" he said.

It would feature a detachable display with two cameras that would integrate with Facebook networks, including Instagram, the site reported. ""It's part of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to build more consumer devices that circumvent Apple and Google, the two dominant mobile-phone platform creators that largely control Facebook's ability to reach people,"" the Verge said.

But it has also been criticised within the VR community for requiring a Facebook account to use its newer products. Virtual reality headsets for work ‘could snowball’Facebook boosts power and cuts price of VR headsetAugmented reality differs from virtual reality in that it mixes projected images with the real world. Among the best known examples are Google's ill-fated Glass spectacles and Microsoft's Hololens platform. Other technology titans such as Apple are also thought to be researching future mainstream products in AR. But Facebook is known to have expressed an interest in the commercial smartwatch space, dominated by Apple.  Main competitorAnd it is widely reported to have been one of the main bidders to acquire fitness smartwatch brand Fitbit, eventually bought by Google. Google's own WearOS smartwatch system is widely reviewed as the main competitor to apple's WatchOS but lacking many important features.  Since acquiring Fitbit, Google has announced the upcoming WearOS 3 will merge with Samsung's well respected Tizen watch system. The move is widely seen as a bid to improve the open system to more firmly compete with the Apple Watch.

""This data collection threatens to provide foreign adversaries with access to that information,"" he said.TikTok is used by about 80 million Americans every month.Ashley Gorski, a senior lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), welcomed the decision to overturn the ban.""President Biden is right to revoke these Trump administration executive orders, which blatantly violated the First Amendment rights of TikTok and WeChat users in the United States,"" she said.""The Commerce Department's review of these and other apps must not take us down the same misguided path, by serving as a smokescreen for future bans or other unlawful actions.""Next week, President Biden is due to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the two are expected to announce a partnership around technology and trade, in an attempt to push back on China's rise as a technology superpower.It is likely the partnership will include joint standards around emerging technologies, as well as commitments to take firmer action policing the internet, and to act on the critical supply chain issues that have arisen during the Covid pandemic.Related TopicsJoe BidenTikTokChinaDonald TrumpUnited StatesSocial mediaMore on this storyTikTok asks defeated Trump if it's still bannedPublished11 November 2020TikTok lives to see another day in USPublished13 November 2020How did TikTok escape a US download ban?Published29 September 2020Top StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

How cow poo is powering crypto mining - BBC News,"How cow poo is powering crypto mining - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechHow cow poo is powering crypto miningBy Chris VallanceBBC NewsPublished9 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightCryptohunterimage captionCrypto-mining farmer Philip Hughes (centre) and Josh Riddett, with one of their bovine colleaguesAt Philip Hughes farm, near the Berwyn mountain range, not far from the Snowdonia National Park, in Denbighshire, cattle chew the lush valley pastures and flocks of sheep clothe the hills.In a green shipping container next to a large domed tank, a very different kind of farm also thrives in this idyllic landscape - a cryptocurrency farm.Philip Hughes's family have farmed the land for generations - but now he is turning his hand to mining, using powerful computers powered by renewable energy to generate new cryptocurrency.And that energy is derived, as Philip puts it, from ""cow muck"". Anaerobic digestionA big six-cylinder engine running at 500rpm turns methane given off by decomposing cow manure into electricity. The process is called anaerobic digestion. In the absence of oxygen, microbes break down the manure and produce methane, which can be combusted to produce heat and electricity, instead of entering the atmosphere where it would act as a powerful greenhouse gas. What's left over can be used as fertiliser.Mining EthereumAbout two-thirds of the electricity generated by the anaerobic digester helps power the farm and the farm's caravan park - but the remainder powers mining rigs, specialist computers about the size of a suitcase. They are working on complex computations that serve to verify transactions and in return are rewarded with new cryptocurrency - a process that can consume large amounts of energy.Presently, they are mining Ethereum.  image copyrightEasycryptohunterimage captionSome more traditional sources of farm incomeThe income has been good but ""it does very much depend on what day you ask that question"", Philip says, with a nod to the notorious volatility of this digital product. The value of Ethereum has fallen from over $4,000 (£2,800) in May to about $2,400 at the time of writing.Computer-graphics cardsPhilip has also started leasing out his renewable energy. The rigs powered by the digester are a mixture of those he owns and others belonging to third parties.At a cost of about £18,000, each rig is stuffed with ""lots of very powerful computer-graphics cards"", according to supplier Josh Riddett, who runs Easy Crypto Hunter, in Manchester.   And while the energy consumption of Ethereum mining is high, it is significantly less than mining Bitcoin and may yet be reduced further.Masked thievesJosh has been pitching cryptocurrency mining to small-scale renewable electricity generators for some time - he says his equipment is in 42 sites covering solar, hydro and wind-powered generators in addition to anaerobic digestion. But some small-scale hydro projects are wary because they worry about the environmental impact of the cryptocurrencies.  And others doubt cryptocurrencies will be valuable for long enough or consistently enough to repay the considerable capital investment hydropower requires.image copyrightGetty ImagesOut of the British Hydropower Association's 290 members, the association's CEO Simon Hamlyn, knows of just two who are trying out crypto mining. One has purchased a number of rigs to install at sites in Northern Ireland.But the other fell victim to a heist, when masked thieves crossed fields to break into the powerhouse and steal the rigs.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionAn e-waste problem in the making?Previously, the main mechanism for developing renewable-energy schemes was the feed-in-tariff, which paid renewable generators for the electricity they fed into the grid.The tariff started in 2011 and a boom in renewables followed - but the amount it pays has declined and it closed to new generators in 2019. ""We're not going to be able to move to green energy unless the government revitalises the subsidy, or we start looking at alternatives,"" Josh says. But renewable energy used to mine cryptocurrency cannot be used for other purposes, such as powering electric cars or heating homes. Maximum capacityIf cryptocurrency is as socially valuable as any of those things, this might not matter - but for critics such as financial economist Alex de Vries, who writes the Digiconomist blog, it is a waste of green energy.""The utility these systems can have is inherently extremely limited,"" he says. ""If you look at Bitcoin, it can only process seven transactions per second at most - that's its maximum capacity. ""You have to consider that a payments provider like Visa can do 65,000 transactions per second if needed."" 'Gold rush'The decline of heavy industry has left some parts of the US with a surplus of hydroelectric power and the resulting cheap electricity has attracted cryptocurrency miners. But communities that have experienced a ""gold rush"" of crypto miners have found it a mixed blessing, pushing up electricity prices. And some, such as Plattsburg, have temporarily banned crypto mining. Alex worries also about the limited lifespan of mining equipment, which he says can rapidly become obsolete, creating an e-waste problem.And rather than switching to renewables, many say it would be better to make cryptocurrencies more efficient - or stop using them altogether.Sparked interestIn the UK, the Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association says only a ""small handful of plants"" are exploring crypto mining. And Philip is very aware his cryptocurrency business is based upon producing an asset whose value can change dramatically, sometimes in response to a single remark by Elon Musk or Donald Trump.If the market collapses, he says, he will put the computing power of the rigs to other uses.But some seem more speculative than others, such as setting the boxes of graphic cards to work rendering computer animation for film-makers such as Disney.His venture into crypto has sparked interest, though.Other farmers interested in the project have called him, Philip says.And it is ""a lot easier to run a computer, than a herd of cows or a flock of sheep"".

""Zoom had extraordinary growth - from a few hundred thousand users in the first two months of 2020 to more than 13 million in April and May,"" the report said.TikTok growthThe report found many people were glued to their phones. Mobile apps cost British people nearly £2.45bn with most going on Tinder, Disney+, YouTube and Netflix.TikTok grew rapidly, Ofcom said, from three million adult visitors in September 2019 to 14 million by March this year. Young adults aged 18-24 more than doubled the time they spent on the short-form video app each day, from 17 minutes to 38 minutes in September 2020.And, as the High Street was forced to close, online sales rose by almost half.MisinformationHalf of adults said that news and information was a big reason they went online - but they often encountered misinformation. Some 46% of UK adults who looked for information about the pandemic said they had found misleading or untrue information.Among the most commonly shared falsehoods in the first quarter of 2021 were that face masks offered no protection or caused harm, and that the number of deaths linked to coronavirus was much lower than reported.The report found that ""adults are as likely to use social media to find information about the Covid-19 pandemic as they are to use news sites and apps"" with Facebook the main source. However, only 16% who used Facebook for information about Covid-19 said they trusted it as a source.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionTikTok - popular in many countries of the world - also took off in the UKPornhubAround one in eight online adults and more than one in five of those aged 15-34 said they used an online dating service before the first lockdown. But the money lost to romance scams increased 12% to reach £18.5m.Nearly half (49%) of UK adults visited an adult website or app in September 2020. Ofcom found the largest site, Pornhub, was visited by around half of all UK online men, but just over one in six of online women.In December, the site removed millions of user-generated videos from view after the New York Times alleged it  was ""infested"" with illegal material, allegations its parent company Mindgeek denied.Digital divideThe report notes that while many benefited from access to the net, it meant that in Ofcom's words ""lockdown had a greater effect on people who are digitally excluded"".It noted nearly one in five over-64s and roughly one in 10 in lower socio-economic households did not have internet access, turning a digital divide into a social one.The digital divide also extended to schoolchildren. It found that nearly all children had access to the internet, but 4% had access only by mobile phone. One in five children lacked a device that would be suitable for doing school work on.While children spent more time online, the report found nearly half reported ""negative experiences"" . On mobile phones, 30% of these negative experiences were being contacted online by someone they didn't know who wanted to be their ""friend"".Related TopicsInternetOfcomTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

But it also reportedly demanded confidentiality and its role in the case was only identified during a legal fight between Pegatron and its insurers, over the compensation it paid to Apple.In 2019, in a similar case an Apple Store employee allegedly texted himself an intimate photo of a woman, taken from her phone after she took the device to be repaired. Apple immediately launched an investigation and said the individual was no longer at the company.The incident will add weight to the growing Right to Repair movement in the US, which argues that devices such as iPhones should not be locked into official repair shops. Some 20 states have proposed Right to Repair legislation, which would force Apple and other manufacturers to make tools and components available to third party technicians.Related TopicsInternet privacyAppleMore on this storyApple worker 'texts himself woman's private photo'Published13 November 2019'It's your device, you should be able to repair it'Published30 AprilTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished5 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe disruption has led some to question the wisdom of having so much internet infrastructure in the hands of a few companies.Jake Moore, a cyber-specialist at security firm ESET said: ""This highlights the importance and significance of these vast hosting companies and what they represent.""Adam Smith, a software testing expert with the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, said outages with content delivery networks ""highlight the growing ecosystem of complex and coupled components that are involved in delivering internet services"".""Because of this, outages are increasingly hitting multiple sites and services at the same time.""Stephen Gilderdale, senior director at Dell Technologies, said such outages were bound to occur occasionally but that they would be rare and brief.""Cloud providers build in redundancies for such events to give their users secure access to replicated copies of data. ""In most cases, services are only affected for a short time, and data is easily retrievable. Far from being a cause of concern, it shows the resilience of the network that it can recover so quickly.""It is estimated that even an hour's worth of downtime could cost companies up to $250,000 (£176,000), and some lawyers think there could be compensation claims.""Liability for loss of service will probably be covered by the service level agreement with customers of paid-for cloud services but the agreements will typically not cover all losses sustained,"" said Prof Rebecca Parry of Nottingham Law School.

Until now, the platform has only worked between Apple devices.The new features form part of its latest operating system, iOS15.""Allowing Apple owners to invite Android and PC users to FaceTime calls via a browser acknowledges the pandemic has sparked explosive growth in group video calling,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.

Some note-taking apps have used optical character recognition (OCR) for similar reasons for years, but Apple's solution is baked into the phone operating system itself.Health appThe health app can now track walking steadiness and issue alerts if a user appears less steady, along with exercise suggestions as to how it might improve.Apple also enabled health app data sharing with doctors, and between family members, but only with the health app user's consent. The encrypted data is not visible to the tech giant, it stressed.image copyrightAppleimage captionApple boss Tim Cook introduced the WWDC conferenceHowever, there may be a cultural barrier to overcome here, said Ben Wood.""The ability to share health data with other family members looks an interesting idea on paper, but it is hard to see that many parents would want to share updates with their children,"" he said.There may, for example, be a number of reasons why a person's heart rate increases which are not medical emergencies.Others, like Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies, said she could see it being taken up by families who live far away.""My biggest worry over the pandemic was my mom and asking how she was felt like nagging her,"" she tweeted.Related TopicsInternet privacyAppleAppsMore on this storyFacebook v Apple: The ad tracking row heats upPublished26 April'Spy pixels in emails have become endemic'Published17 FebruaryGoogle promises to drop personalised ad trackingPublished3 MarchTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished6 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

But some private-sector organisations will be able to see it, with permission.And critics point to the controversial involvement of US data company Palantir in the analysis of other NHS data.The firm - sometimes described as the ""scariest"" of America's tech giants - is known for supplying  data-sifting software to government agencies, and has been linked to to efforts to track undocumented migrant workers in America.Hashtag #NhsdatagrabA petition organised by Open Democracy - part of a group of organisations mounting a legal challenge to the GPDPR - has been signed more than 16,000 times.

""Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our wellbeing, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple,"" the letter said. ""Over the last year we often felt not just unheard, but at times actively ignored,"" it also reads, accusing management of a ""disconnect"" with employees on the topic of remote or flexible working.Is Big Tech going off remote working? Facebook accused of forcing staff back to officesThe Verge reported that the letter was sent out to Apple employees to gather signatures last week, despite a line in the letter saying it ""is not a petition, though it may resemble one"".Mr Cook's memo to staff said that he missed ""the hum of activity"" of in-person working, and that he knew ""I'm not alone"".The three-day per week in-office requirement applies across the board, he said - with teams that need to work in-person requiring a four or five-day week in the office.In the rebuttal from employees obtained by The Verge, they asked for:Apple to leave remote working decisions up to individual teamsA company-wide survey on the topic across teams and the whole companyExit interviews to specifically ask about ""employee churn"" because of remote workA plan to accommodate disabilities through both remote and on-site workingInformation on the environmental impact of in-person on-site work compared with remote workingGoogle has already issued similar orders to staff, telling them to return to work three days a week by September.But other tech giants have taken a more relaxed approach to the return to work, as pandemic restrictions ease across the world.Facebook has announced it believes remote work is ""the future"" and that staff may continue to work from home - even though it has been criticised for ""forcing"" contractors back into offices.And as far back as May 2020, Twitter told its staff that they can work from home ""forever"" - but with the caveat that it is only the case if the employee role can accommodate it.Related TopicsTim CookAppleFlexible workingMore on this storyApple wants staff back in offices by SeptemberPublished3 JuneIs Big Tech going off remote working?Published6 AprilFacebook and Google extend working from homePublished8 May 2020Facebook accused of forcing staff back to officesPublished18 November 2020Twitter allows staff to work from home 'forever'Published13 May 2020Facebook staff can 'continue working from home'Published19 AprilGoogle rejigs remote working as it reopens officesPublished1 AprilTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished6 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Bumble will also enable its members to share pandemic dating preferences such as views on social distancing, mask-wearing and whether users are comfortable meeting in crowded places.I’m under 30 - which Covid vaccine will I get?image copyrightBumbleimage captionBumble's profile includes ""Covid preferences"" in terms of how a potential date might work.Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi described the new initiative as an ""incredible asset"" to the UK's Covid-19 vaccination programme.A recent YouGov poll of nearly 5,000 UK adults found that only 28% of those who responded said they would not date someone unvaccinated, with 2% saying they would not date someone who had received the jab.In England and Wales people aged over 30 are now eligible for the vaccine. In Northern Ireland and Wales it is available to everyone over 18. The government says that around 40 million people have received at least one of the two doses so far.However, there are some concerns around vaccine status and privacy. Last month the NHS revised its booking system in England after complaints that it was possible to work out how many jabs an individual had received, by inputting basic details such as their name and postcode.Privacy campaigner Dr Stephanie Hare said that because the dating app badge is voluntary and no official documentation is required, the privacy risk is low.""It's already very common in the gay male dating community to share HIV status,"" she added.LGBTQ-focused dating apps such as Grindr and Scruff have so far not been named in the government's Covid jab scheme.View commentsRelated TopicsPrivacyCoronavirus pandemicCoronavirus vaccinesDating appsDatingOnline datingMore on this storyHow can I get my second jab sooner?Published1 day agoPerks for jabs: Would you get the vaccine for free beer?Published21 MayTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished6 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished6 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

United plans supersonic passenger flights by 2029 - BBC News,"United plans supersonic passenger flights by 2029 - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechUnited plans supersonic passenger flights by 2029By Chris FoxTechnology reporterPublished5 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightUnited/Boomimage captionA digital model of the new Overture aircraft in United liveryUS airline United has announced plans to buy 15 new supersonic airliners and ""return supersonic speeds to aviation"" in the year 2029.Supersonic passenger flights ended in 2003 when Air France and British Airways retired Concorde.The new Overture aircraft will be produced by a Denver-based company called Boom, which has yet to flight-test a supersonic jet.United's deal is conditional on the new aircraft meeting safety standards.What is supersonic flight?Supersonic flight is when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound. At an altitude of 60,000ft (18,300m), that means flying faster than 660mph (1,060km/h). A typical passenger jet may cruise at about 560mph (900km/h) but Overture is expected to reach speeds of 1,122mph (1,805km/h) - also known as Mach 1.7.image copyrightReutersimage captionConcorde was retired in 2003At that speed, journey times on transatlantic routes such as London to New York can be cut in half. Boom says Overture would be able to make the trip in 3.5 hours, shaving three hours off the flight.Concorde, which entered passenger service in 1976, was even faster with a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 - about 1,350mph (2180km/h).What are some of the challenges?There are two major concerns with supersonic passenger travel: noise and pollution.Travelling faster than the speed of sound causes a sonic boom, which can be heard on the ground as a loud thunderclap or explosion. It's where the company Boom got its name.The boom limits where the planes can fly. Typically they must lower their speed until they are out over the ocean, away from citizens who may be disturbed by the loud bang.Boom says it is confident that its plane will not be any louder than other modern passenger jets while taking off, flying over land and landing. It also hopes improvements in aircraft design since Concorde will help it reduce and mitigate the sonic boom.The other big issue is fuel consumption.""In order to fly supersonic, you will need more power, you will need more fuel,"" Kathy Savitt, Boom's chief commercial officer, told the BBC.But she expects Overture to be operated as a ""net-zero carbon aircraft"".Can supersonic travel really be 'sustainable'?Central to Boom's plan is for Overture to run entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (Saf).That can take the form of ""posh biodiesel"" made out of everything from waste animal fat from the farming industry to specially grown high-energy crops, explains Dr Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University.But one big problem is that ""the world is very far from having anything like the production capacity needed"" to produce enough biofuel to power the entire aviation industry, he says.Boom predicts ""power-to-liquid"" processes - where renewable energy such as wind power is used to produce liquid fuel - will make up the shortfall.""We expect that to be commercialised well before it's needed for our purposes,"" explains Boom's Raymond Russell. ""There are billions of dollars of both airline commitments and investments across the sector.""But it remains an industry that needs to be scaled up.image copyrightUnited/Boomimage captionA digital model of the new Overture aircraft in United livery""Can you suddenly find an enormous additional supply of sustainable electricity at affordable prices?"" asks Dr Gratton.""I'm not saying it can't be done. It may well be done but it has not been done yet.""Is there demand for supersonic travel?Despite the enormous cost of Concorde's development more than 50 years ago, it is thought to have been profitable for British Airways in its final years of operation.Concorde was seen as a luxurious way to travel with tickets costing more than a first class seat on a regular jet.Today, the wealthiest travellers may favour private business jets, says Dr Gratton.Rather than travel first class on a commercial jet with the public, the rich can charter compact private planes that fly on demand, directly to-and-from their airports of choice. Avoiding the check-in desk and luggage carousel can shave time off travelling too.Ms Savitt said Boom's research suggested passengers wanted speed and that faster planes could ""deepen human connections and make better business relationships"".Unlike Concorde, the company expects Overture to be profitable for airlines even if tickets are sold for the same price as a ""regular business-class fare"".Ultimately, it is up to United to set its prices - but it will want to see a return on its $200m-per-plane (£140m) investment.

It appears to come from a genuine friend because that account has already been hijacked.""I got a WhatsApp message from my good friend Michelle, saying she was locked out of her account,"" one victim, called Charlie, told the BBC.""She said she accidentally sent the access code to my phone instead of hers, and could I just screenshot it and send it over.""In reality, Charlie had sent the access code for his own account to the scammer.""I think I fell for it because we all know how frustrating tech can be and I was eager to help,"" he told the BBC.""It took me a day to realise what had happened.""Charlie said he had deleted WhatsApp and would not be using it again. He has switched to Apple's iMessage instead.What do the scammers do with stolen accounts?With a stolen account, the hijacker can message your friends and family, and pretend to be you.They may pretend you're having a crisis and ask your contacts for money.It also gives them your contacts' phone numbers so they can try the six-digit code trick with new victims.By hijacking your account, the scammer will also remain in your group chats, where they could see sensitive information.How can you protect yourself?In a statement, WhatsApp said: ""The safety and security of our users and their messages are really important to us.

Patient data transfer still set to start in July - BBC News,"Patient data transfer still set to start in July - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechPatient data transfer still set to start in JulyBy Chris VallanceBBC NewsPublished4 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesThe government is proceeding with the creation of a central store of data from GP records in England next month, despite the NHS suggesting a delay.The data is moving to a central NHS Digital database, with the Department of Health saying it expects GPs to introduce the system from 1 July.The NHS wanted a delay until September so patients had more time to learn about the system, the BBC has learned.Critics worry the data could be misused by third parties.Under a new system, called General Practice Data for Planning and Research, data from surgeries in England will be added to an NHS Digital database in ""near real-time"".The programme will also extract data from records created up to 10 years ago.Patients have until 23 June to opt out.There is widespread agreement that the data could be of great value to research, but doctors are concerned the public is not well enough informed about what is happening.The British Medical Association and Royal College of General Practitioners have issued a rare joint letter to express their ""concerns about the lack of communication with the public"". The letter calls for NHS Digital to ""take immediate action to run a public information campaign"".Some GPs in east London have reportedly already refused to hand over patient data, citing the lack of an effective information campaign to tell the public about the changes.Whether to delay, and in what form, has been the subject of intense discussions this week.But on Thursday night, the Department of Health said in a statement that it expected the system to start on 1 July. It added that the plan would ""provide benefits to patients across England"" and that it was putting support in place.""The new programme for collecting data has been developed in collaboration with doctors, patients and data, privacy and ethics experts to build on and improve systems for data collection,"" the statement said.Medical privacy campaign group MedConfidential criticised the decision to proceed as potentially ""destroying public trust and harming research in the process"".Informed consentCampaigning law group Foxglove is supporting a coalition of organisations to challenge the scheme in court, and has sent a pre-action letter to the Department of Health and NHS Digital.The letter warns that unless the government pauses the scheme and seeks ""meaningful patient consent"", the group will seek an injunction to halt it.This is not the first time the NHS has sought to extract data from GP records. In 2016, a scheme called Care.data was abandoned and questions were raised about the adequacy of efforts to inform the public about it.As part of Care.data, every household in England was sent a leaflet about the programme and the possibility of opting out, although a survey by the BBC suggested that less than a third recalled getting one.Big dataNHS Digital says it will collect a range of information including data about ""physical, mental and sexual health"", while details of gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation will also be included.The NHS says the data will only be used for planning and research purposes, that each application to use it will need approval from advisory groups.It may not be used ""solely"" for commercial purposes or for insurance, marketing, promoting or selling products or services, or market research.However, some private sector organisations will be able to see it with permission, and critics are worried about the type of organisations that may gain access. They point to the controversial involvement of firms like US data firm Palantir in the analysis of other NHS data.Research rewardLast year there were more than 300 requests for GP data using ""legacy systems"". NHS Digital says GP data has benefited millions during the pandemic, helping the most vulnerable, rolling out the vaccination programme and identifying live-saving Covid treatments.Prof Martin Landray, who jointly leads the ""Recovery"" trial which helped identify treatments for people hospitalised with Covid-19, told the BBC Tech Tent podcast there were many conditions where data needed for research was held only in GP records.  He said researchers could already request data from GPs, but the new system would bring consistency to how it is used and controlled.""I can understand why at one level 'all my data is going to be made available' sounds scary,"" he said.""I don't think that we should view it in that way.""Related TopicsNHSMore on this storyNHS deals with US tech firm 'will be transparent'Published31 MarchYour NHS data: Can the web’s creator fix it?Published9 November 2020Top StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished6 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished7 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

AirTags were released in April and were promoted as a way for people to keep track of their belongings. However, critics warned that the coin-sized tracker could be easily used to monitor someone's real-time location. Following the update, AirTags will beep if they are away from their owner's iPhone - at a random time between eight and 24 hours - to alert people nearby. AirTags should update their software automatically when they are close to the owner's iPhone. Spying concernsWhen it announced AirTags in April, Apple said it had designed features to prevent them being used to stalk people.The device is small enough to be placed inside a bag or a coat pocket, which raised concerns about its potential for misuse. If an iPhone detects that somebody else's tracker is following it around, it is supposed to display an alert. The tags were also programmed to beep if they were away from their owner's iPhone for three days, potentially allowing the owner to be tracked without their knowledge.People with Android smartphones do not see an on-screen warning.Several reviewers said they had used AirTags to successfully track friends or family.Kirk McElhearn wrote on tech blog Intego that he had posted one of the trackers to a friend in south London. After the device was delivered, the friend left the envelope on his kitchen counter. Mr McElhearn said his AirTag failed to alert his friend of its presence after more than four days in his house. Some reviewers have also suggested the 15-second warning beeps are not loud enough to be heard over everyday household noises. ChangesFollowing the update, an AirTag will beep at a random time between eight and 24 hours if it is away from its owner's iPhone.Apple says it is also planning to introduce safeguards for Android users.""Later this year, we will also introduce an Android application that will enable users to detect an AirTag or Find My network-enabled accessory separated from its owner that may be travelling with a user,"" said the company in a statement.

"Parkinson's, AI and me - BBC News","Parkinson's, AI and me - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechParkinson's, AI and meBy Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondentPublished4 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightDiane Coyleimage captionRory Cellan-Jones was first diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2019For two weeks recently I got into a steady routine. At 10:30 each morning, I  would sit at my kitchen table, strap three devices containing sensors to my right arm, and switch on a tablet computer. Then I would spend 20 minutes going through a series of exercises monitored  by a man who popped up in a window on the screen.The results of my endeavours will, I hope, help millions of people like me dealing with Parkinson's disease. My daily routine was part of a medical trial run by engineers from Imperial College and a start-up company they have founded, in collaboration with a consultant neurologist at London's Charing Cross Hospital. Its aim - to use artificial intelligence techniques to develop a wearable device that could monitor the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and even perhaps help to treat it.For me that is an exciting prospect. I was diagnosed with Parkinson's in January 2019 and the first thing I was told was that there is no cure for this disease which afflicts something like 10 million people and is the world's fastest growing neurological condition.'Notoriously difficult'There is medication to treat the symptoms but it is notoriously difficult to prescribe exactly the right dose of Sinemet and other drugs which act to replace the missing dopamine that makes someone with Parkinson's shake or drag their foot. In my case, it was not clear to me that the drugs were working.That is how I ended up being sent by my own consultant at St Mary's Hospital Paddington for a second opinion from Dr Yen Tai, the neurologist at Charing Cross working with Imperial College. After he had prescribed me a new drug, we got talking about technology and how it might help in the battle against Parkinson's. When he offered to enrol me in the Imperial trial, I leaped at the chance.image captionAI is at the forefront of breakthroughs in helping those with Parkinson's live with the diseaseThe exercises I did each morning - twisting my hand from side to side, holding it out in front of me, moving my arm up and down - were similar to what my consultant makes me do on my visits every four months. The idea is that the data recorded by the sensors and the video of the session will gradually teach the AI system how to grade symptoms in the way a human doctor does.Neurologists use what's called the UPDRS - the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score - to calibrate the severity of a patient's symptoms. Earlier in the trial, other patients of Dr Tai had been assessed by him at his clinic, and his UPDRS ratings were then fed into the AI system as part of its learning data.Funding boost for Parkinson's disease sensor penParkinson's skin-swab test 'in sight'Ravi Vaidyanathan, reader in biomechanics at Imperial College and principal investigator for this research programme,  laughed when I said the aim seemed to be to take Dr Tai's brain and put it in the AI. ""We are a few light years from being able to take what Yen's brain can do,"" he said."" But we are trying to take his diagnostic capacity into the automated system. And that's how machine learning works.""The Imperial team is not alone in exploring how wearable devices could be used to diagnose and monitor Parkinson's. ""Wearable sensors are quite a popular hot topic in Parkinson's research for a number of years now,"" says Dr Tai.  A team at Apple, working with medical specialists, showed how the Apple Watch could be used to monitor symptoms and measure their response to medication. But the Imperial team believes their trial goes further than any other in collecting data about all of the main Parkinson's symptoms - stiffness of the limbs, tremor and slowness of movement.What is exciting is what comes next. Later this year, SERG Technologies, the spinout from Imperial working to commercialise this research, hopes to have something much less clunky - ""a nice, lean simple device,"" says Ravi Vaidyanathan. image captionThe smart device could help doctors to offer those living with the disease more tailored treatment plans'Tailored treatment'""At first this could be used once more to put patients through various exercises to assess their symptoms but later the idea is that it could just collect data as people went about their daily lives.""So when you just pick up a cup of coffee, when you pick up a pencil, when you pick up a pen, we would have something that you could wear unobtrusively all day that would keep recording what you are doing.""Coupled with data about when a patient takes their medicine, the smart device could then provide continuous monitoring of how a patient responded. ""Hopefully this will provide a more personalised, more tailored treatment to an individual patient,"" says Dr Tai.Further ahead, the wearable device could actually provide treatment. A new project supported by a £1m grant from  the National Institute of Health Research, will explore shooting tiny amounts of current into the patient's  muscle to control tremors.For all the work being done here and around the world to improve the monitoring and treatment of Parkinson's, there is still no cure on the horizon.""Ultimately we still need to have something that can slow down the brain degeneration process,"" Dr Tai says. ""But it doesn't mean we can't optimise treatment at the same time while we are trying to find a cure for Parkinson's.""I hope to continue on this journey seeking a better understanding and improved treatment of Parkinson's. I will report back on any progress.Related TopicsArtificial intelligenceParkinson's DiseaseMore on this storyFunding boost for Parkinson's disease sensor penPublished25 JanuaryWoman with Parkinson's had benefit removedPublished2 JuneTop StoriesNorth Korea in ‘great crisis’ after Covid lapsesKim Jong-un berates top officials in a rare sign of the pandemic's severity in the country.Published1 hour agoHong Kong's year under China's controversial lawPublished6 hours agoUS general warns of civil war after Afghan pulloutPublished7 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

No date has been announced for other countries, but previous listings in mobile app stores have suggested it will eventually cost $2.99 in the US and £2.49 in the UK.Blue perksTwitter said subscribers will get ""perks"" - giving examples such as customisable app icons for phone home screens and what it calls ""fun colour themes"" for the app.But they will also have access to a ""dedicated"" customer support, the company says.The additional features that Twitter says were inspired by user requests include:Bookmark folders, designed to help users organise saved tweets more easilyUndo tweet, which will let users set a timer of up to 30 seconds after posting before it appears publicly - to allow quick correction of obvious mistakesReader mode, which turns long threads of tweets into easier-to-read textimage copyrightTwitter""We will be listening to feedback and building out even more features and perks for our subscribers over time,"" it said.It does not, however, include verification in the form of a ""blue tick"" on a user profile, which cannot be bought. Twitter recently re-opened its verification applications for the first time in years, but was forced to shutter the programme for a few days after just a week of accepting them, because it was inundated with requests.Twitter made no secret of plans to charge its top users a small fee for some extra perks - but it's only dipping its wing in the water for now.The much-asked-for undo tweet button is undoubtedly top of the list, for all of us who've ever had a screamer of a typo, or - even worse - accidentally tweeted something we meant to search for.But other features are squarely targeted at the Twitterati elite. When Twitter bought web reader firm Scroll in May, it made a big deal about Twitter being for news and discussion. Bookmarks and the reader feature for long threads are firmly targeted there.And for good reason.Twitter's growth in active users has slowed in recent years - a potential problem for any social network, where perceived value is often based on numbers. Twitter has never had the users that Facebook has - it boasts hundreds of millions, but not billions. But many of its biggest users are media personalities, politicians, and business leaders - the type of people for whom a small monthly fee might not be too much to ask.This is new territory. Unfounded rumours that Facebook might one day ask for a fee have led to digital panic in the past - so Twitter's two-country opener is a test to see if the idea will fly.

The company has also been more conservative regarding its working from home policy than other tech giants. Facebook announced last year that its employees could work from home full-time as long, as they get approval from their manager.

Norton antivirus adds Ethereum cryptocurrency mining - BBC News,"Norton antivirus adds Ethereum cryptocurrency mining - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechNorton antivirus adds Ethereum cryptocurrency miningPublished3 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesIn a surprise move, one of the world's best-known anti-virus software makers is adding cryptocurrency mining to its products. Norton 360 customers will have access to an Ethereum mining feature in the ""coming weeks"", the company said.Cryptocurrency ""mining"" works by using a computer's hardware to do complex calculations in exchange for a reward. It is not clear what the business model for Norton Crypto is, or if Norton will take a cut of earnings.The company pitched the idea as a safe and easy way to get into mining, an ""important part of our customers' lives"". In a press release, Norton LifeLock - once called Symantec - said: ""For years, many coin miners have had to take risks in their quest for cryptocurrency, disabling their security in order to run coin mining."" That is true, in so far as anti-virus software packages such as Norton itself often falsely identify widely used mining programs as dangerous, and the antivirus software often needs to be deactivated to continue the mining process. Buying a pink NFT cat was a nightmarePolice raid cannabis farm, find Bitcoin mineNvidia limits crypto-mining on new graphics cardNorton also warns of ""allowing unvetted code on their machines"" and the danger of storing earnings on a hard drive which could fail. But most keen miners use a small selection of well-regarded mining apps - some of which are little more than simple command-line scripts - and a digital wallet that is stored on the web or on a smartphone. Pooling millionsMining Ethereum as a solo miner is very difficult, relying on luck and powerful computing hardware to receive coins. Screenshots provided by Norton seem to suggest that the system will instead use a ""pool"" - where a very large number of miners all contribute whatever computing power they have and split the reward based on how much work their machines did. But such pools almost universally take a percentage cut - a 1% cut of all earnings being a widely used standard. image copyrightNortonimage captionA screenshot provided by Norton showing its mining interfaceIf Norton pursues such a model it would, in effect, leverage its millions of customers' computers to generate a new income stream. And the process uses a lot of energy - which may mean higher energy bills for unsuspecting consumers. The company told CNN it was considering adding other cryptocurrencies in addition to Ethereum in the future. The move has been met with some scepticism among technology enthusiasts. Security site BleepingComputer pointed out that in the United States, where Norton has a strong customer base, cryptocurrency income is taxable, reportable income, which casual miners running antivirus software may not be aware of. And tech news site The Verge highlighted that Norton often comes pre-installed on many laptops, offering free service for a while before asking for a subscription. ""It's easy to imagine a company, not necessarily Norton, offering cheaper or even free computers, if you just turn your unused computing cycles into a recurring source of profit for the bloatware makers subsidising your purchase,"" it wrote. ""Norton may be opening a door here that's hard to close.""

Huawei operating system coming to smartphones in Asia - BBC News,"Huawei operating system coming to smartphones in Asia - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechHuawei operating system coming to smartphones in AsiaBy Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporterPublished2 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightHuaweiAn update of HarmonyOS, the operating system developed by Huawei, means it will now be installed in a wider range of products, including its smartphones.It was showcased in a major conference streamed worldwide on Wednesday ahead of its launch across Asia.There is no date for the operating system's global rollout yet.Huawei also showed off a new smartwatch model, tablet, and accessories, with a focus on how HarmonyOS works across devices and home appliances.A trade ban imposed by the US last year effectively prevented Huawei devices from working fully with Google's Android platform because it blocked access to essential apps like Gmail.The trade ban imposed by former US President Donald Trump did not stop Huawei handsets from using Android altogether but limited their functionality.HarmonyOS has so far only been available in some smart TVs.However, Huawei said it did not consider Harmony to be a replacement for Android, which accounted for 85.4% of smartphones shipped in 2019.Apple's iOS had the remaining 14.6%, according to the research firm IDC. Other operating systems such as Samsung's Tizen and Amazon's Fire have failed to disrupt the handset market.No new phonesDuring Wednesday's launch, the focus remained firmly on how the new operating system works with other internet connected devices, such as tablets, smart speakers and televisions.It showed versions of the new system running on its phones, and also on two new products - the Huawei Watch 3 and MatePad Pro tablet.There was no new Huawei smartphone revealed, with the company saying its next major model, the P50, did not yet have a planned release date.But it did tease the upcoming device with a partly-obscured render of the phone's back, showing four cameras contained in an array of two large circles.In its video demos, Huawei suggested that files and other content could be passed between phones, tablets, TVs and computers with ease by using its unified HarmonyOS system. ""HarmonyOS is designed to provide the glue between a growing array of connected devices that Huawei is targeting,"" commented Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight.""Huawei will be hoping that it can follow Apple's lead, by having a single software platform that extends in all directions, providing a seamless experience to customers that buy into its ecosystem of products.""China's official Xinhua News Agency reports that the Shenzhen-based tech giant is anticipating 300 million devices to be equipped with HarmonyOS by the end of the year. There was great excitement in China when the operating system launched, with one person calling it the possible ""start of our technological take-off"". ""The long-awaited system is here,"" said one social media user on micro-blogging site Weibo.""Building the world's largest mobile phone system is just around the corner!"" another added. But there also looked to be some teething issues, with some users saying they couldn't update to the OS immediately on their phones - which got responses from others calling for them to continue trying.

It is controlled by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and chaired by Lord Davies of Abersoch, a former Labour Minister for Trade, Investment and Small Business and Infrastructure. The project also received positive comments from two government ministers, including the Digital Infrastructure minister Matt Warman.Upp's announcement follows a number of investments by firms looking to finance fibre broadband in areas where copper lines have not been replaced, the Financial Times reports.Mark Jackson, editor of broadband specialist site ISPReview, said several schemes and incentives were behind the trend: ""Over the past few years we've seen various changes that have helped to make the market more attractive.""Mr Jackson suggested that business rates relief on new fibre, changes to regulations, and government-backed investment schemes had all contributed to an increasingly crowded market.""What we are seeing today thus essentially stems from the seeds that were being planted by the Government and Ofcom around three to four years ago"" he added.Related TopicsBroadbandMore on this storyFirst areas to get fast broadband upgrade revealedPublished19 MarchBroadband switches should be less 'hassle' - OfcomPublished3 FebruaryTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published15 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

In 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Mr Musk of misleading investors, after he made claims about taking Tesla private. An agreement was made requiring Tesla's lawyers to pre-approve certain tweets. But documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal suggest the regulator believes Mr Musk and Tesla have broken the terms of that deal.According to the newspaper, the SEC wrote to Tesla alleging that Elon Musk's Twitter account had violated the deal twice.One tweet made claims about Tesla's stock price ""being too high"", while the other made claims regarding the company's solar roof production. One of the terms of the settlement was that Tesla's lawyers must pre-approve tweets that relate to things such as production numbers, new products and the company's finances. Elon Musk tweet wipes $14bn off Tesla's valueMusk reaches deal over tweetsWhen Elon Musk was reprimanded by the SEC in 2018 and forced to submit sensitive tweets to Tesla's lawyers in future, did anyone think that would really work? The man who had tweeted: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured""  - without having that funding tied down - seemed unlikely to change his spots. And so it has proved.The tycoon has in fact become even more incontinent and prolific in his tweeting, whether it is raging about the Californian authorities for wanting to shut his factory at the beginning of the pandemic, propelling shares in Gamestop higher amid the speculative frenzy around the company, or helping turn Dogecoin from a joke into a crypto-currency success story.To be fair, he has been more careful in his tweets about his own companies, though predictions about Tesla's self-driving capabilities or the progress of his brain interface project Neuralink may have raised eyebrows. But it's the Musk effect - the fact that any tweet about a quoted company or crypto-currency can send its value soaring - which must worry the SEC.Short of ordering the volatile entrepreneur to close his Twitter  account, however, it's not clear what the watchdog can do. Tesla told the SEC it believed Mr Musk's contentious tweets were not covered by the agreement, since they were ""aspirational"" or opinion, the Journal reported, citing documents obtained using a Freedom of Information request.The SEC disagreed, the newspaper's documents show.""In the face of Mr Musk's repeated refusals to submit his covered written communications on Twitter to Tesla for pre-approval, we are very concerned,"" the SEC wrote.It urged the company to ""reconsider its position"" and enforce controls and procedures ""to prevent further shareholder harm"".Following accusations of misleading investors in 2018, Mr Musk was forced to resign as chairman of Tesla as a result, and he was fined $20m (£14.1m). Mr Musk did not admit any wrongdoing. In an interview with news channel CBS at the time, he said he had ""no respect"" for the SEC, but he had chosen to pay the settlement fine because he believed in the justice system.Related TopicsCompaniesElon MuskTeslaMore on this storyElon Musk tweet wipes $14bn off Tesla's valuePublished1 May 2020Musk: Twitter blocked me for Bitcoin tweetPublished23 October 2018Elon Musk reaches deal over tweetsPublished26 April 2019Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch dogecoin moon missionPublished10 MayElon Musk changes title to 'Technoking of Tesla'Published15 MarchTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published15 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

"Amazon warehouse injuries '80% higher' than competitors, report claims - BBC News","Amazon warehouse injuries '80% higher' than competitors, report claims - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechAmazon warehouse injuries '80% higher' than competitors, report claimsPublished2 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesEmployees at US Amazon warehouses are injured at a higher rate than those doing similar jobs at other companies' warehouses, a new report has found. A union-backed study of safety data found Amazon workers had 5.9 serious injuries per 100 people - almost 80% higher than the rest of the industry. The study's organisers blamed Amazon's ""obsession with speed"" as a main cause of the problem. It is the latest in a string of controversies around worker safety. Earlier this year, the company apologised for falsely denying that its drivers are forced to urinate in plastic bottles. That came alongside a wider string of allegations that employees both on driving routes and in warehouses are under too much time pressure to use bathrooms, which Amazon denies. And during the first wave of the pandemic, the company was accused of ""cutting corners"" on Covid safety - something it also denies. New York sues Amazon over 'deficient' Covid responseAmazon worker fight: 'You're a cog in the system''Epidemic of injuries'This new study comes from the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC), a coalition of labour unions. It analysed workplace safety data reported to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration from 2017 to 2020. It found that ""workers at Amazon warehouses are not only injured more frequently than in non-Amazon warehouses, they are also injured more severely"". Workers forced to take time off for injuries were absent for an average of 46.3 days, it said - a week longer than the average across the warehouse industry. And compared to its largest retail competitor Walmart, Amazon's overall injury rate was more than double, at 6.5 per 100 employees compared with three.An independent analysis of the same data by The Washington Post reached similar conclusions.The SOC characterised the report as an ""epidemic of workplace injuries"". In a statement, Amazon said it invested more than $1bn (£705.9m) in work place safety last year, growing its safety team to more than 6,200 people.""While any incident is one too many, we are continuously learning and seeing improvements through ergonomics programs, guided exercises at employees' workstations, mechanical assistance equipment, workstation setup and design, and forklift telematics and guardrails - to name a few,"" a spokesman said.He also pointed towards its ""WorkingWell"" wellbeing programme, something Amazon boss Jeff Bezos highlighted in his recent shareholder letter in which he committed to reducing workplace injuries.'Industrial athletes' But technology news site Motherboard has this week published an Amazon warehouse pamphlet issued under the ""working well"" branding, which tells workers they should think of themselves as ""industrial athletes"".""Just like an athlete who trains for an event, industrial athletes need to prepare their bodies to be able to perform their best at work,"" it warns. ""Some positions will walk up to 13 miles a day... [others] will have a total of 20,000lb (9,072kg) lifted before they complete their shift,"" it said. The pamphlet, from a Tulsa warehouse, also offers tips on health and fitness. It encourages exercise on days off, a good diet to fuel the 400 calories an hour the company expects employees to burn, and tips on buying shoes to fit swollen feet from the active working environment. Amazon told Motherboard that the pamphlet had been created in error and removed - though the employee who gave it to the publication said it was available on-site for months.  Legalised weedIn a separate development for US Amazon employees, the company also said it will stop testing some employees for marijuana use. ""We will no longer include marijuana in our comprehensive drug screening programme for any positions not regulated by the Department of Transportation, and will instead treat it the same as alcohol use,"" the company said in a blog post. ""Given where state laws are moving across the US, we've changed course,"" executive Dave Clark wrote - but added that people would still be checked for impairment ""after any incident"". To back that stance, Amazon will back federal legislation that would legalise marijuana and expunge past criminal records, he said.

eBay sellers can no longer use PayPal under new terms - BBC News,"eBay sellers can no longer use PayPal under new terms - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTecheBay sellers can no longer use PayPal under new termsPublished1 JuneSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightReutersNew terms of use for eBay have come into effect which mean the online auction house will now pay sellers directly rather than through PayPal. PayPal was acquired by eBay in its early days in 2002, and the two firms have worked in partnership ever since. The changes mean that while eBay buyers can still pay with PayPal, sellers will be paid straight into their bank accounts. But some sellers have threatened to stop using the service over the move. EBay's forums have several posts from sellers who say they are reluctant to use the new system and give eBay direct debit access to their personal bank accounts.But the new terms, effective from 1 June, say the new ""managed payments"" system is compulsory, and the company has the power to limit or remove listings from sellers who refuse to use it. The company says the new system is simpler, convenient, and gives buyers more payment options - and the rollout will be gradual.It marks a significant change in an almost two-decade partnership with PayPal, which split from eBay in 2015.What's changing? The managed payments system means that PayPal fees will no longer be added to the process, though eBay has made its own fees slightly higher. But the company claims most people will pay the same as - or less than - before. The new system is 12.8% of the final amount including delivery, plus 30p in the UK ($0.30 in the US). The old system was 10% for eBay, plus PayPal's fees, plus 30p. The difference favours the new system to the tune of pennies for most transactions. The move also means that buyers will automatically have access to every payment option available - including credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and PayPal Credit. eBay boosted by Christmas surge in online ordersRegulators allowed to take down eBay listings However, payments will now take two working days to be transferred, while PayPal was usually on the same day. The feature has been rolled out since about 2018, an eBay spokesperson said - with business sellers moving first. An estimated four million sellers are already using it.The deadlines for all users are phased - so while many sellers are required to move to the new system from 1 June, others will receive a message from eBay in the coming weeks and months.What's the problem? The terms and conditions make using the new system mandatory.In part, the reluctance is because eBay has a strong reputation for protecting buyers - sometimes at the expense of sellers. Some unscrupulous fraudsters have been known to buy a product on eBay, swap it for a damaged or different item, and return the package demanding a refund.  media captioneBay has a new authentication scheme in the UK to help sniff out counterfeit trainersSome sellers believe eBay regularly sides with the buyer in such cases - and fear that refunds would be taken out of their bank accounts under the new system. Late last year, ahead of the impending change, another forum user wrote: ""They are so heavily biased in the buyer's favour... I am simply not prepared to switch to this new [system] and give eBay direct access to my bank account."" EBay, for its part, says the direct debit scheme adheres to the same rules any other direct debit, such as a phone bill. That means customers will have advance notice of how much is being taken out, and any incorrect or fraudulent payments should be refunded.Other users were confused by the switching process requiring them to enter their online banking usernames or passwords. But those credentials are only used by the bank. The company says it does not have any actual direct access to sellers' bank accounts.Related TopicseBayPayPalMore on this storyeBay drops PayPal as first payment choicePublished1 February 2018eBay to split off PayPal businessPublished30 September 2014Regulators allowed to take down eBay listingsPublished10 MayHow to sniff out fake trainersPublished29 AprileBay boosted by Christmas surge in online ordersPublished3 FebruaryTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published16 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Others highlight the ""accept all"" in a green colour or make it more prominent.Noyb - an acronym for ""none of your business"" - says that kind of form is designed to make it ""extremely complicated to click anything but the 'accept' button"". Most sites 'do not comply'To combat this, the group has created an automated system, which it says can find violations and auto-generate a complaint under GDPR. It claims ""most banners do not comply with the requirements of the GDPR"". Fines can be up to €20m (£17.5m) or 4% of a company's global revenue, whichever is higher. Of the 500 pages in its first batch of complaints, 81% had no ""reject"" option on the first page, but rather hidden in a sub-page, it said. Another 73% used ""deceptive colours and contrasts"" to lead users into clicking ""accept"", and 90% provided no easy way to withdraw consent, it said.Google fined £91m over ad-tracking cookiesTech Tent: The end of ad tracking?Noyb says it is first issuing draft complaints to 10,000 of the most-visited websites across Europe, along with instructions on how to change settings. But it says that if firms do not comply within a month, it will file full formal complaints with enforcement authorities. ""If successful, users should see simple and clear 'yes or no' options on more and more websites in the upcoming months,"" the group said. 'Frustrating people' Mr Schrems, the chair of the group, is a well-respected privacy advocate who has lodged successful legal challenges in the past. In July last year, he successfully had an agreement that governed the transfer of EU citizen's data to the United States struck down by Europe's highest court.  Mr Schrems said this latest campaign was designed to combat ""a whole industry of consultants and designers"" making ""crazy click labyrinths"". ""Frustrating people into clicking 'okay' is a clear violation of the GDPR's principles,"" he said, accusing firms of trying ""to make privacy a hassle for users.""media captionWATCH: What is GDPR?""They often deliberately make the designs of privacy settings a nightmare, but at the same time blame the GDPR for it.""This narrative is repeated on hundreds of pages, so users start to think that these crazy banners are required by law."" The legal basis for cookie consent is complicated, involving an older set of rules called the ePrivacy Directive as well as the more recent GDPR, and a range of national data protection authorities which enforce the rules.Data protection and privacy expert Pat Walshe said that the way the advertising industry had approached the rules had ""led to confusion at best"".""In my humble opinion, a lack of regulatory enforcement has emboldened the ad industry and in part led to the current state of the 'data vampire' infested web and app experiences,"" he said.""In light of the lack of regulatory enforcement the Noyb action is welcome.

The app had favoured original content in its ""stories"" feature over existing, re-shared posts, but will now give them equal treatment, it said. The current system had a ""bigger impact than expected"" on some types of posts. But that was an unintended side-effect rather than an attempt to censor any particular viewpoint, Instagram said. During the recent Gaza conflict, social media platforms were heavily used to spread messages of support on both sides.  Many pro-Palestinian messages were among those widely re-shared - which means they would have received less prominence than original posts under the current system.How Israeli-Palestinian conflict plays out on social mediaThe Israel-Palestinian conflict explained A company spokeswoman said the logic for prioritising original posts was that most Instagram users had more stories to follow than time to check them - and the company believed people were ""more interested in original stories from their closest friends"". ""It's also caused people to believe we were suppressing stories about particular topics or points of view. We want to be really clear - this isn't the case,"" she said. ""This applied to any post that's re-shared in stories, no matter what it's about."" Instagram has seen an increase in how many people are re-sharing posts in general, the platform said - and is now acknowledging that posts not ""getting the reach people expect them to"" is ""not a good experience"".   The spokeswoman also said the company had seen this issue over a long period of time, and it was not solely a reaction to the recent controversy. Bias allegationsThe change follows a number of weeks in which some users - and employees - questioned how Facebook handled posts about the Gaza conflict on its own site and on apps it owns such as Instagram. Buzzfeed News reported on internal strife about the way Palestinian-related content often had warnings attached, while the Financial Times reported that a group of up to 50 employees had been involved in raising concerns about supposed suppression of pro-Palestinian content. Many of the issues are believed to have been caused by large-scale automated moderation, rather than deliberate attempts by individuals to restrict content, reports said. Instagram said this newly announced shift towards equal weighting of original posts and re-shared stories will happen over time, rather than being an instant change. ""We still think people want to see more original stories, so we're looking at other ways to focus stories on original content through things like new creative tools,"" it added.

Noisy appliances: How loud is your house? - BBC News,"Noisy appliances: How loud is your house? - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechNoisy appliances: How loud is your house?By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporterPublished31 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesIn a residential street in south London, dozens of household appliances are being put through their paces - not to measure how well they work, but how loud they sound. The room we're in is officially a laboratory. There's no soundproofing in sight: noise bounces gleefully off the sort of hard surfaces and shiny floors you'll find in many modern homes. A device shaped like a human head is rigged up to a monitor displaying colourful graphs, recording every whizz, rattle and beep. Environmental consultancy firm Quiet Mark has spent the last 10 years awarding its colourful ""Q"" logo to the quietest household appliances in every category you can think of - from hairdryers and air purifiers to kettles and washing machines. It's something of a labour of love for founder Poppy Szkiler, whose grandfather, John Connell, established the Noise Abatement Society in 1959. She says that since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, people have become a lot more conscious of the noise inside their homes.""It's becoming a mega-trend,"" she says.""People are looking to create more peaceful homes because life has become literally under one roof.""image captionPoppy Szkiler says sound quality can be more important than volumeNow the firm, which describes itself as a consumer champion, is looking to change the way we measure sound. Currently when you shop for an appliance, if it does have a noise rating, that figure will be in decibels - and that tells you how loud it is.Ms Szkiler says about 40 decibels (dB) is ideal for inside the home. However, 40dB of a smooth, consistent hum is very different from 40dB of clunking, rattling or screeching. Currently, though, unless you work in the field of acoustic sciences, there's no consumer-friendly measurement for overall sound quality.Quiet Mark is on a mission to change that and is currently researching ways to include sound quality in the rating it awards the products it assesses.""In addition to decibels, we are measuring tumble dryers, which often have a big droning sound, and we're measuring jeans - and how the buttons hit the centre of the drum - to measure the sound quality, the pitch and tonality. And we are seeing which appliances are best insulated and isolated, for the best noise reduction within our home,"" she explains.image captionThe firm seeks out the quietest brands of household appliancesThere isn't even a term for it yet - but there is a demand.Quiet Mark is already listed on the sites of various UK retailers, including Argos, Littlewoods and John Lewis.John Lewis's technology director, Laurence Mitchell, says there are more than 10,000 searches a month for appliances that include the term ""quiet"" on the retailer's website. There's a ""quiet revolution"" tab on John Lewis's appliances page, and washing machines and kettles are the devices most likely to be linked to the search.But he says consumers should be prepared to pay more for a quieter life.""If you look at things like appliances, to have a lower noise level you may need things like an inverter direct-drive motor (which reduces the number of motor components, and therefore noise, particularly in washing machines), or increased dampening, and of course those things come with a cost,"" he says.Part of the difficulty in finding the right way to label sound quality is that it's such an individual experience - what's music to my ears may be painful to yours. And on a serious note, continued exposure to loud noise has been linked to health conditions, including heart problems.People who are neurodiverse may also find some sound challenging.For example, Tom Purser, of the National Autism Society, says that autistic adults and children process sensory information - including sound - differently.""For some autistic people, it will mean certain types of noise, certain tones, certain frequencies will be almost painful to them. But for some, there will be certain types of noise and sounds they really enjoy and find themselves seeking,"" he says.""It's a very difficult experience when the world is full of so many different sorts of sound and noise on a daily basis.""image captionInside the lab at Quiet MarkPoppy Szkiler admits she appreciates the sound of silence - the quieter her home environment, the better for her. She hopes that manufacturers will take note of a wider demand for tech that is seen but barely heard.""There's huge levels of integrity and wonder in engineering,"" she says.""Acoustic engineering is just as important as energy efficiency, or the way something looks, or its performance.""Related TopicsNoise pollutionMore on this storyNoise pollution 'drowns out ocean soundscape'Published4 FebruaryHospital noise levels 'growing worse'Published19 November 2018Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published19 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

That means the vehicle can slow down or switch off automated driving features if the driver starts looking at their phone, for example.A new software update for Tesla cars, reported by several media outlets, reveals that the camera above the car's rear-view mirror will start performing a similar function.It ""can now detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged,"" the release notes say.media captionA British driver was banned for leaving the driver's seat on the M1 in 2018But Tesla also said that ""camera data does not leave the car itself"" and no data is transmitted unless data-sharing is enabled in the car's settings, which can be changed by the user at any time.Tesla, which disbanded its press team last year, has not issued a statement about the reasons behind the new feature.But it comes after several recent stories about the company's so-called ""Autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" features, which are more accurately described as driver-assistance features.In April, one of the most influential consumer magazines in the United States claimed that Tesla cars could easily be tricked into operating without a driver.Safety ratings rowThat report came days after a fatal crash in Texas, which police initially said happened when no-one was in the driver's seat - although this is now disputed.And the new feature coincides with Tesla losing safety endorsements from Consumer Reports - the same magazine which investigated tricking the Autopilot system - and a major insurance group.Earlier this week, Tesla announced that its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles sold in the US would no longer include radar sensors, but would instead use camera-based systems and more advanced software.Tesla itself said that its move away from radar would mean some key features would be ""temporarily limited or inactive"", and would be ""restored"" in the coming weeks through software updates.The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the US told news agencies it plans to remove its ""Top Safety Pick Plus"" label for those cars due to the missing radar, while Consumer Reports will also pull its ""Top Pick"" award for both.It follows the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - an official public body - removing marks on its website for safety features such as forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.Consumer Reports' Jake Fisher said: ""It is extremely rare for an automaker to remove safety features from a vehicle during a production run, even temporarily, but this isn't the first time that Tesla has done this.""The magazine pointed to a 2016 issue in which some Model X cars were sold without the automatic emergency braking feature, which took months to fix.Related TopicsCar industryCar TechnologyTeslaMore on this storyCrashed Tesla's autopilot was off, says reportPublished11 MayTesla Autopilot 'tricked' to run without driverPublished23 AprilAutopilot seat-switch driver bannedPublished28 April 2018Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published25 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Meanwhile a tech business, founded more than 100 years ago, wants to prove it can use big data to prosper without damaging the environment. On this week's Tech Tent we explore whether Bitcoin is going green and if the jet engine business Rolls Royce can still innovate.Listen to the latest Tech Tent podcast on BBC SoundsThe key idea behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralised and nobody is in charge.But this week a group of North American Bitcoin miners, with the encouragement of crypto-enthusiast Elon Musk, decided to take charge.Well, to be clear, the members of the self-appointed Bitcoin Mining Council decided they would act to deal with a major image problem for the cryptocurrency: its energy use. As Tech Tent has reported, the process of creating new coins and recording transactions uses as much electricity each year as a country the size of Argentina.That issue has seen China and Iran move to ban cryptocurrency mining, and that has contributed to the wild swings in the Bitcoin price seen recently.  Jaime Leverton, chief executive of Hut 8 Mining, one of the members of the Bitcoin Mining Council, tells the programme the aim is to ""counter the noise and some of the misinformation that's coming at the Bitcoin mining industry"".She says they want to ""shape the narrative around the cryptocurrency industry's energy usage"" to address concerns that the industry is not environmentally friendly. How Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubbleDorsey and Musk agree on bitcoin's green potentialPolice raid 'cannabis farm', find Bitcoin mineShe insists that Bitcoin mining equipment - essentially computers packed with specialised chips - is getting much more efficient and quotes a study showing 39% of the energy used in mining comes from renewable sources.But North America only accounts for a small proportion of mining, with much of it taking place in China using electricity from coal-fired power stations. Even if there is a ban in China, Reuters is reporting that many miners are planning to move to oil-rich Kazhakstan, with its abundant cheap, non-renewable energy.The finance writer Frances Coppola, a long-term critic of cryptocurrencies, concedes that the North American miners are now taking the environmental impact of their activities seriously. But she points out that even a greener Bitcoin presents many problems.""Bitcoin, because it is an add-on to existing financial systems, actually increases emissions - it's going to increase emissions just because it exists. And there are also things like the ransomware threats - criminals use Bitcoin for ransomware demands,"" she said.While this new technology is grappling with its impact on the climate, a much older industry - air transport - has been under pressure to cut its carbon footprint for years. Coupled with that, the effects of the pandemic have had a disastrous impact on the industry's finances.But on a visit to the engine-maker Rolls Royce, founded at the beginning of the last century, we found a workforce determined to innovate its way out of trouble.At its Derby plant, a vast new engine test facility opened this week, designed for the new UltraFan engine which the company says will ""redefine sustainable air travel"" - though it will be the end of the decade before it goes into production.Elsewhere, new technology - from snake robots that allow keyhole surgery on engines to augmented reality training applications which means airline engineers don't have to travel to Derby to update their skills -  is helping to cut costs.But the key to a sustainable future for both the environment and Rolls Royce's finances is data. These days, every engine sold is packed with sensors constantly sending data back to Derby for analysis.The company's chief digital officer, Stuart Hughes, says collecting that information is vital if engines are to be kept in the air rather than in the repair shop as long as possible.""Some of our engines when they came off an aeroplane might take up to 200 days to go through the repair shop,"" he explains.""We use that data to reduce the amount of time that an engine is unavailable to the airline -  data is absolutely critical.""Two very different technologies, cryptocurrencies and aerospace, are trying to adapt to a fast-changing world.But what is fascinating is how differently they are valued by investors. Rolls Royce, after major cuts to its workforce, still employs more than 40,000 people, but the market currently puts a value on the business of about $13bn (£9.2bn). By contrast, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase - a new arrival on the stock market - is valued at over $50bn.Still, as we have seen over recent weeks markets can change their minds very quickly. It is perfectly possible that the engine-maker will be worth more than the crypto exchange a year from now.

However, consumers should always be alert, especially to the use of fake websites and bogus celebrity endorsements,"" said Jason Costain, NatWest's head of fraud prevention. The Financial Conduct Authority has a searchable list of unauthorised firms and individuals offering financial services. People using these will not be protected by the UK's financial authorities if something goes wrong, the FCA warns.'All your money'The app alert, which NatWest said was an urgent reminder, tells customers:a ""trader"" getting in touch with promises of big profits and assistance in setting you up on a scheme ""is a scam""if you can't access your own crypto-wallet or you did not set it up yourself, you should cease all payments to itmake sure any cryptocurrency seller you want to use is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority ""You could lose all of your money,"" without following the advice, it warns.Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile in value. This month the price of Bitcoin alone has fluctuated by up to 40% - creating some big winners and losers in the process. It is not regulated by any financial authorities.There has been a flurry of advertising around crypto-investments on social media, and on Wednesday the Advertising Standards Authority banned an ""irresponsible"" billboard ad for a cryptocurrency exchange which appeared on London transport.In the US, cryptocurrency scammers pretending to be Tesla boss Elon Musk made more than $2m (£1.4m) in six months, consumer-protection officials said in May.COULD PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS HELP TREAT DEPRESSION?: A ground-breaking trial looks for answersSCAM CITY: The student at the centre of an alleged multi-million-pound fraudRelated TopicsFraudCryptocurrencyBitcoinMore on this story'Irresponsible' buy Bitcoin advert bannedPublished26 MayBitcoin: From buying a Bentley to losing it allPublished9 FebruaryTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published26 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

These are run through its facial recognition software and stored on a database, access to which is sold on to private companies and law enforcement agencies.""Clearview seems to misunderstand the internet as a homogeneous and fully public forum where everything is up for grabs,"" said Lucie Audibert, a legal officer at PI. ""This is plainly wrong. Such practices threaten the open character of the internet and the numerous rights and freedoms it enables.""""Just because something is online does not mean it is fair game to be appropriated by others in any way which they want to - neither morally nor legally,"" said Alan Dahi, data protection lawyer at noyb.""Data protection authorities need to take action and stop Clearview and similar organisations from hoovering up the personal data of EU residents,"" he added.Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist at Surrey University, said the case will open a complicated legal debate  ""about who owns images placed online and how possible it is to enforce any rights if the images are taken across a national boundary"".And there will be more fundamental questions about whether Clearview is invading privacy ""by using these images in their database to enable government agencies to identify individuals"", he said.Californian opt-outClearview AI is no stranger to controversy and has faced a flurry of legal challenges.The UK and Australian data regulators launched a joint probe last year, while Sweden has fined its national police authority for using the firm's technology to identify people.In February, Canada's federal privacy commissioner Daniel Therrien ended a year-long investigation into the firm, concluding that it collected images without user knowledge or consent and demanding that it delete photos of Canadians from its database. During the investigation, Clearview announced it would no longer operate in Canada.In the US, the American Civil Liberties Union is pursuing a lawsuit against the company in Illinois while Californian data laws mean users in the state can opt out of having their data sold, via a form on Clearview's website. The firm came to prominence in January 2020 when a New York Times investigation revealed its business practices.Shortly afterwards, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube demanded that Clearview stop collecting images from its platforms.The business has deals with hundreds of police forces in the US.Related TopicsInternet privacyArtificial intelligenceFacial recognitionMore on this storyFace-collecting company database hackedPublished27 February 2020Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published26 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

You know the fundamental story…was about a government who could see everything that everyone did and hear everything that everyone said all the time.“Well, that didn’t come to pass in 1984, but if we’re not careful that could come to pass in 2024.” China's AIIn certain parts of the world, reality is increasingly catching up with that view of science fiction, he added. China’s ambition is to become the world leader in AI by 2030, and many consider its capabilities to be far beyond the EU.In 2019, China beat the US at the number of patents secured by academic institutions for innovation in AI technologies.54% of the world’s 770 million CCTV cameras are in China, according to research by Comparitech.Eric Schmidt, former Google chief executive who is now chair of the US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has warned that beating China in AI is imperative. “We’re in a geo-political strategic conflict with China,” he said. “The way to win is to marshal our resources together to have national and global strategies for the democracies to win in AI. “If we don’t, we’ll be looking at a future where other values will be imposed on us.”image captionDr Eric Schmidt chairs the US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.Dr Lan Xue, who advises the Chinese Government, said facial recognition could prove ""tremendously helpful"" in identifying people in mass gatherings if there is a ""major accident"".""China indeed has made tremendous progress in technology development,"" Dr Xue added. ""[The US] feels that this is a threat… and they wanted to start this Cold War on technology.""Although China has ""huge differences"" in its values and politics, the country's ""vision of the world is not convergence but co-existence,"" said Dr Keyu Jin, associate professor at the London School of Economics.""China does not seek to export its values,"" she added.Project MavenDr Schmidt became an adviser to the Pentagon in 2016, while retaining a position as executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company.In the following years, Google started a contract with the Pentagon, allowing it to use some of its image recognition technologies as part of a military project.Project Maven used machine learning to distinguish people and objects in drone videos.“Maven at the time was…a way of replacing human eyes by automatic vision for the drone footage that was being used in the various Arab conflicts,” Dr Schmidt said. “I viewed the use of that technology as a net positive for national security and a good partnership for Google.”‘Blood on my hands’But the project received criticism from Google employees who resigned, and petitioned against the project.media captionArtificial intelligence: Machines given power to kill?“Google should not be involved in the business of war,” said software engineer Laura Nolan who resigned in 2018, when she discovered the nature of the project Google was working on. “I kinda felt like I had blood on my hands.”She argued the technology could be used in future targeting decisions.But Google said its AI would only be used for non-offensive purposes, before completely withdrawing from Project Maven in June 2018.Dr Schmidt said he felt technology which could help the military make the right decisions was a ""good thing.""AI arms raceBut the Department of Defence continues to seek partnerships in Silicon Valley, in a bid to win the global AI arms race.Seth Moulton, chair of the US Future of Defence Task Force is urging tech companies to support the Department of Defence. “Because we're in a race, because we are in this competition, that’s really what it comes down to,” he said. “Are you going to help us win this race or are you going to essentially be against us?“China does not have the same system of government as we do.""Could the AI arms race lead to conflict with China? Absolutely.”Dr Xue agreed there was potential for conflict: ""But it is not inevitable - the US and China should really collaborate to prevent that from happening.""Watch Panorama's Are you Scared Yet, Human? on BBC iPlayer (UK only)Related TopicsGoogleChinaArtificial intelligenceMicrosoftMore on this storyCould blacklisting China's AI champions backfire?Published8 October 2019Pentagon uses Google tech 'for its drones'Published7 March 2018Tech experts caution on killer AIPublished29 July 2015Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published29 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

To change it:Go to SettingsEnter the new Posts section Select Hide Like and View CountsEven if a user has Like Counts enabled, they will not be able to see the number of likes on accounts or posts that have hidden them.Users will also have the option hide counts on a specific post, before and after it goes live on the platform.'Less worried'“The spirit of this is to give people a choice,” Mr Mosseri added, using the example of going through a break-up in a relationship or switching schools.“Maybe you want to be a little bit less worried about how many likes everyone's getting for a couple weeks or a couple of months, and then maybe you want to switch back.“If it’s a one-way door, people tend to get hesitant about using the control.”Instagram’s algorithm will still take the number of likes into account when promoting posts on the platform, but it also takes into consideration other factors, such as what the user follows or engages with.Mr Mosseri said there had been a ""polarised"" reaction from creators - accounts which make money through brand partnerships and advertising on the platform - but that the new feature didn’t affect revenues.Instagram for childrenEarlier this year, concerns were raised over leaked plans to design a version of Instagram for children.Plans to create an Instagram for under-13s were not ""fully fledged"", Mr Mosseri said, explaining that it was difficult to verify ages, as children often didn't have IDs.""It has to be more responsible to give parents oversight and transparency than to have kids continue to lie about their age.""He said the app would ""take some time"" to create.View commentsRelated TopicsFacebookMental healthInstagramSocial mediaMore on this storyInstagram hides likes count 'to remove pressure'Published18 July 2019Teens, tech and mental health: Study finds no linkPublished4 MayInstagram 'worst for young mental health'Published19 May 2017Instagram fixes appetite suppressant mistakePublished15 AprilTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published29 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The area is also home to highly controversial ""re-education centres"", called high security detention camps by human rights groups, where it is estimated that more than a million people have been held. Beijing has always argued that surveillance is necessary in the region because it says separatists who want to set up their own state have killed hundreds of people in terror attacks.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionXinjiang is believed to be one of the most surveilled areas in the worldThe software engineer agreed to talk to the BBC's Panorama programme under condition of anonymity, because he fears for his safety. The company he worked for is also not being revealed. But he showed Panorama five photographs of Uyghur detainees who he claimed had had the emotion recognition system tested on them.image captionData from the system purports to indicate a person's state of mind, with red suggesting a negative or anxious state of mind""The Chinese government use Uyghurs as test subjects for various experiments just like rats are used in laboratories,"" he said.And he outlined his role in installing the cameras in police stations in the province: ""We placed the emotion detection camera 3m from the subject. It is similar to a lie detector but far more advanced technology.""He said officers used ""restraint chairs"" which are widely installed in police stations across China.""Your wrists are locked in place by metal restraints, and [the] same applies to your ankles.""He provided evidence of how the AI system is trained to detect and analyse even minute changes in facial expressions and skin pores.According to his claims, the software creates a pie chart, with the red segment representing a negative or anxious state of mind.He claimed the software was intended for ""pre-judgement without any credible evidence"".The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to questions about the use of emotional recognition software in the province but said: ""The political, economic, and social rights and freedom of religious belief in all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are fully guaranteed.""People live in harmony regardless of their ethnic backgrounds and enjoy a stable and peaceful life with no restriction to personal freedom.""The evidence was shown to Sophie Richardson, China director of Human Rights Watch.""It is shocking material. It's not just that people are being reduced to a pie chart, it's people who are in highly coercive circumstances, under enormous pressure, being understandably nervous and that's taken as an indication of guilt, and I think, that's deeply problematic.""Suspicious behaviourAccording to Darren Byler, from the University of Colorado, Uyghurs routinely have to provide DNA samples to local officials, undergo digital scans and most have to download a government phone app, which gathers data including contact lists and text messages.""Uyghur life is now about generating data,"" he said.""Everyone knows that the smartphone is something you have to carry with you, and if you don't carry it you can be detained, they know that you're being tracked by it. And they feel like there's no escape,"" he said.Most of the data is fed into a computer system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, which Human Rights Watch claims flags up supposedly suspicious behaviour.""The system is gathering information about dozens of different kinds of perfectly legal behaviours including things like whether people were going out the back door instead of the front door, whether they were putting gas in a car that didn't belong to them,"" said Ms Richardson.""Authorities now place QR codes outside the doors of people's homes so that they can easily know who's supposed to be there and who's not.""Orwellian?There has long been debate about how closely tied Chinese technology firms are to the state. US-based research group IPVM claims to have uncovered evidence in patents filed by such companies that suggest facial recognition products were specifically designed to identify Uyghur people.A patent filed in July 2018 by Huawei and the China Academy of Sciences describes a face recognition product that is capable of identifying people on the basis of their ethnicity.Huawei said in response that it did ""not condone the use of technology to discriminate or oppress members of any community"" and that it was ""independent of government"" wherever it operated.The group has also found a document which appears to suggest the firm was developing technology for a so-called One Person, One File system.""For each person the government would store their personal information, their political activities, relationships... anything that might give you insight into how that person would behave and what kind of a threat they might pose,"" said IPVM's Conor Healy.image copyrightVCGimage captionHikvision makes a range of products including cameras""It makes any kind of dissidence potentially impossible and creates true predictability for the government in the behaviour of their citizens. I don't think that [George] Orwell would ever have imagined that a government could be capable of this kind of analysis.""Huawei did not specifically address questions about its involvement in developing technology for the One Person, One File system but said: ""Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination. ""As a privately-held company, Huawei is independent of government wherever we operate. We do not condone the use of technology to discriminate against or oppress members of any community.""The Chinese embassy in London said it had ""no knowledge"" of these programmes.IPVM also claimed to have found marketing material from Chinese firm Hikvision advertising a Uyghur-detecting AI camera, and a patent for software developed by Dahua, another tech giant, which could also identify Uyghurs.Dahua said its patent referred to all 56 recognised ethnicities in China and did not deliberately target any one of them.It added that it provided ""products and services that aim to help keep people safe"" and complied ""with the laws and regulations of every market"" in which it operates, including the UK.Hikvision said the details on its website were incorrect and ""uploaded online without appropriate review"", adding that it did not sell or have in its product range ""a minority recognition function or analytics technology"".Dr Lan Xue, chairman of China's National committee on AI governance, said he was not aware of the patents.""Outside China there are a lot of those sorts of charges. Many are not accurate and not true,"" he told the BBC.""I think that the Xinjiang local government had the responsibility to really protect the Xinjiang people... if technology is used in those contexts, that's quite understandable,"" he said.The UK's Chinese embassy had a more robust defence, telling the BBC: ""There is no so-called facial recognition technology featuring Uyghur analytics whatsoever.""Daily surveillanceimage captionHu Liu feels his life is under constant surveillanceChina is estimated to be home to half of the world's almost 800 million surveillance cameras.It also has a large number of smart cities, such as Chongqing, where AI is built into the foundations of the urban environment.Chongqing-based investigative journalist Hu Liu told Panorama of his own experience: ""Once you leave home and step into the lift, you are captured by a camera. There are cameras everywhere.""""When I leave home to go somewhere, I call a taxi, the taxi company uploads the data to the government. I may then go to a cafe to meet a few friends and the authorities know my location through the camera in the cafe.""There have been occasions when I have met some friends and soon after someone from the government contacts me. They warned me, 'Don't see that person, don't do this and that.'""With artificial intelligence we have nowhere to hide,"" he said.Find out more about this on Panorama's Are you Scared Yet, Human? - available on iPlayer from 26 MayRelated TopicsChinaArtificial intelligenceUyghursMore on this storyWho are the Uyghurs?Published21 JuneUighur camp detainees allege systematic rapePublished2 FebruaryTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published30 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The statement also accused Google of restricting YouTube access to Russian media outlets, including RT and Sputnik, and supporting ""illegal protest activity.""Google said it receives requests from different government organisations across the world and the laws of each country vary.The company often responds once a court decision has been reached. But it also said it was important to maintain YouTube as an open platform for various kinds of views.Internet trafficIf Google does not act, the watchdog said it could also slow down internet speeds for users in Russia trying to access Google.The state has already used these powers in March, to restrict access to Twitter after Roskomnadzor said it failed to remove around 3,000 posts.Internet service providers in Russia can limit or block the flow of data to websites, making connections slower when accessing certain pages.YouTubeGoogle is currently suing Roskomnadzor over demands that it removes content, according to court documents seen by Reuters. The case involves twelve YouTube videos which include encouraging minors to join unsanctioned protests in January, in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.Mr Navalny has more than 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube, and regularly posts videos on the platform voicing his opposition to President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government.A hearing has been scheduled for 14 July.Related TopicsAlexei NavalnyRussiaGoogleYouTubeMore on this storyRussia slows down Twitter over 'banned content'Published10 MarchRussia 'successfully tests' its unplugged internetPublished24 December 2019Russia tightens control on national internetPublished1 November 2019Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published30 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina'How Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubbleElson Musk tweeted that the group had committed to publish details of the current and planned use of renewable energy.Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 24, 2021
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAccording to a tweet by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who convened the meeting of the group and Elon Musk, the council includes ""the leading Bitcoin miners in North America"". But research from a group of universities suggested that China accounted for more than 75% of Bitcoin mining as of April 2020. The authors estimated that 40% of China's Bitcoin mines were powered by coal.If anything represents free-market capitalism in its most naked form, it is Bitcoin. It is unregulated, there is no central bank or government in charge of its workings - and some true believers in the crypto-currency are extreme libertarians who hope to see the traditional financial system and much of the infrastructure of the state just melting away. So the idea now being promoted by Elon Musk of a Bitcoin Mining Council to promote sustainable energy use in the crypto-currency's processes seems a touch bizarre. The economics of Bitcoin mining demand that the miner seeks out the cheapest available electricity - that may be hydro-electric power in the United States, but has often been coal-fired power stations in China. Even if the Chinese government succeeds in its clampdown on mining, it's likely that miners in countries like Russia will continue to use electricity generated from fossil fuels. American miners may be sincere in wanting to slap a green energy label on their activities - but the wider Bitcoin market may make that either uneconomic or irrelevant.Earlier this month, Tesla suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin, over concerns about its environmental impact. In February it revealed it had bought the equivalent of $1.5bn (£1bn) of the digital currency.  ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Elon Musk tweeted at the time.But the group needs to do more than ""disclosing and promoting the use of renewables"", Alex de Vries of the website Digiconomist told the BBC.""Even if we had disclosure, that doesn't change the natural incentive of these miners to search out the cheapest and most constant sources of power - which typically comes down to (obsolete) fossil fuels,"" he said.""Kentucky even came up with a tax break for Bitcoin miners to come and use their obsolete coalfields. So, I'm not seeing this trend towards more renewables.""However council member Peter Wall, Chief Executive of Argo, argued that increasingly US Bitcoin miners were choosing renewable power. He felt the council could encourage change.""It's early days, it's embryonic.  There will be lots of discussions moving forward about the best way to promote sustainable Bitcoin mining and to do it not just in North America,"" he said.Related TopicsChinaCryptocurrencyElon MuskBitcoinTeslaClimate changeMore on this storyTesla will no longer accept Bitcoin, says Elon MuskPublished13 MayHow Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubblePublished27 FebruaryBitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina'Published10 FebruaryHow do crypto-currencies work?Published12 February 2018Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published30 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Florida governor signs bill to ban Big Tech 'deplatforming' - BBC News,"Florida governor signs bill to ban Big Tech 'deplatforming' - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechFlorida governor signs bill to ban Big Tech 'deplatforming'By Cody GodwinBBC News, San FranciscoPublished24 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a first-in-the-nation bill that can penalise tech companies for deplatforming politicians.The legislation states that platforms can only suspend accounts for 14 days, and will be fined as much as $250,000 (£176,000) per day for violations. NetChoice, a tech lobbying group whose members include Twitter and Facebook, testified against the bill in March.  The bill, believed to be the first of its kind, will take effect on 1 July.Mr DeSantis has been vocal about Big Tech, arguing that platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are silencing conservative voices.Earlier this year, he said Big Tech had ""come to look more like Big Brother"". Legal challenges are expected, with opponents contending that the bill violates Americans' constitutional rights to free speech. Critics also say the new law could have unintended consequences. In March, Steve DelBianco, NetChoice's chief executive, said while testifying against the bill: ""Imagine if the government required a church to allow user-created comments or third-party advertisements promoting abortion on its social media page.""Just as that would violate the First Amendment [guaranteeing the right to free speech], so too does [this bill] since it would similarly force social media platforms to host content they otherwise would not allow.""'Everyday Floridians'Former US President Donald Trump was banned by Twitter and Facebook and suspended by YouTube after the Capitol Hill riot in January.Earlier this month, Facebook's Oversight Board decided to uphold the platform's decision, but asked the social network to review the decision within six months.With Mr Trump barred from multiple platforms, it is unclear what this new Florida law means for any potential comeback for the former president. Twitter declined to comment. Facebook and YouTube have not responded to the BBC's request for comment.Mr Trump spent the first few months of his time after leaving office in Florida. He and Mr DeSantis are seen as ideological bedfellows.According to the Tampa Bay Times, Mr DeSantis was asked if this bill was meant to help Mr Trump, to which he replied: ""This bill is for everyday Floridians."" Exemptions from the lawThe legislation includes a clause that exempts a company ""that owns and operates a theme park or entertainment complex"". Florida is home to the Disney World theme park.NBC Miami reported some lawmakers saw this as ""hypocritical"".""If Facebook buys a theme park, does that prevent us from being able to regulate what happens on Facebook?"" asked Andrew Learned, a Democratic member of Florida's House of Representatives.""So, if they bought a theme park and named it Zuckerland and he met the definition of a theme park under Florida statute, then yes,"" said Republican Representative Blaise Ingoglia.Related TopicsFloridaFacebookYouTubeDonald TrumpMore on this storyFacebook ordered to rethink Trump's banPublished5 MayTrump plans social media comeback, says adviserPublished22 MarchFacebook bans 'voice of Trump' from platformPublished1 AprilHow 'big tech' is taking Trumpism offlinePublished12 JanuaryHow to end 'informational chaos' on social media?Published12 November 2020Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published30 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Epic v Apple: What have we learned? - BBC News,"Epic v Apple: What have we learned? - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechEpic v Apple: What have we learned?By James ClaytonNorth America technology reporterPublished24 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThe much-hyped Epic v Apple trial is due to finish on Monday in California. Epic Games is suing Apple over the way it runs its App Store. It says the store is a monopoly and charges exorbitant fees on games like Epic's popular Fortnite.Apple makes Epic pay a 30% commission on in-app payments. The judge may take weeks, if not months, to make a ruling. But during the three-week trial we've seen some interesting revelations. There is no legal definition of a game Epic wanted to broaden its lawsuit out to all apps on the App Store. Apple wished to narrow the scope to just the makers of games. Hence a lengthy argument as to whether Fortnite is an actual game and, as news site The Verge reported, it's actually quite hard to define.Fortnite may look very much like a game, however, Epic believes it's more than that. Its vice-president of marketing, Matthew Weissinger, said during the trial it was in fact a ""metaverse"". ""It's one of the remarkable things about Fortnite, we're building this thing called the metaverse, a social place,"" he said. This sounds like Epic dancing on the head of a pin. However, other ""games"" like Roblox describe themselves as less of a game, but more of a platform where people live in a virtual world. Apple boss was vague on detail Apple chief executive Tim Cook gave evidence on Friday for the first time at the trial. He was polite and put his arguments forward in a measured way. However, during his cross-examination he was asked several questions about Apple's business that he said he could not answer. image copyrightReutersimage captionApple's chief executive Tim CookFor example, he was asked how profitable the App Store was and said he wasn't sure. We know that Google pays Apple about $10bn (£7bn) to have Google search preloaded on iPhones. However, when asked about it Mr Cook once again seemed sketchy on detail. News site TechCrunch called his performance ""mild, carefully tended ignorance"". media captionEpic Games v Apple: What is going on?Epic pays other firms more than it gives AppleInteresting details about the inner workings of Epic were laid out at the trial.The Washington Post reported that between January 2017 and October 2020, Epic paid $237m in commissions to Apple for Fortnite. However, that is less than the annual amounts it paid to other gaming platforms. For example, in 2020 it paid $245m to Microsoft and $451m to Sony. Epic's argument here is that Sony and Microsoft sell their consoles at a loss, so need to charge developers. Conversely iPhones bring in big profits for Apple. Epic's Tim Sweeney hates App Store paid promotionA curious quirk you may have noticed on the App Store is that if you type a certain app into search, you may well be offered up another app as the first hit. This is a little bit like Google search, where paid for ads are placed at the top of the search - even if they are not the most relevant hits. Apple does this on the App Store and it makes Epic's chief executive Tim Sweeney extremely cross. In an email to Apple in 2018 , he said he found it ""super-frustrating that Fortnite is not the first search result when customers search for the text 'Fortnite'"".

The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterOther companies too have complained that this practice hurts smaller companies which can't pay for promotion.Most of Apple's App Store revenue comes from gaming apps Mr Cook was tight-lipped on the App Store's profit margins. However, when asked by the judge he confirmed that ""the majority of the revenue on the App Store comes from games"". Judge Rogers replied: ""And in-app purchases in particular, right?""""Correct."" Mr Cook said. What came next from the judge will worry Apple.""But you could also monetise it a different way, couldn't you? I mean, that is, the gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it's almost as if they're subsidising everybody else,"" the judge said. It's likely we won't get a ruling until later this summer. Who will win? Well, anti-trust trials are notoriously hard to to predict. However, most analysts believe this is Apple's to lose. But even if Epic doesn't win, the company has done a good job at publicising what it claims are unfair business practices from Apple - issues that won't go away even if Apple is victorious.James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

Three years of GDPR: the biggest fines so far - BBC News,"Three years of GDPR: the biggest fines so far - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechThree years of GDPR: the biggest fines so farPublished24 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesIt's been three years since the introduction of Europe's data privacy and security law on 25 May 2018.GDPR governs the way organisations that operate within the EU can use, process and store consumers' personal data.At first smaller firms and start-ups feared they did not have adequate resources to fully comply with its rules. Other critics suggested the legislation relied too much on consumers knowing and understanding their rights.Since its launch, hundreds of millions of euros worth of fines have been handed out by information commissioners around Europe. Offences have included retailers misrepresenting the way they use CCTV cameras to monitor employees, and companies not complying with the ""right to be forgotten"" law. The legislation replaced older data protection laws, and while it was drafted in Europe, regulators can fine organisations anywhere in the world which target or collect data in the EU.media captionWATCH: What is GDPR?There are two tiers of penalties, with a maximum of 20m euros (£17.29m) or 4% of global revenue. The money collected is used to fund public services. Here are the biggest fines recorded so far:1. Google (€50m/£43.2m)Google was one of the first companies to be hit by a substantial GDPR fine of €50m in 2019.It was fined after a French regulator ruled that the company had failed to make its consumer data processing statements easily accessible to its users. The tech giant was also found guilty of not seeking the consent of its users to harness their data for targeted advertising campaigns. Google appealed, but France's higher court upheld the fine in June last year.2. H&M (€35.3m/£32.1m)H&M was fined by German regulators in 2020 after it was found to have been secretly monitoring hundreds of its employees. If workers took holiday or sick leave, they were required to attend a meeting with senior staff at the retail giant on their return. These meetings were recorded, and made accessible to H&M managers without the knowledge of staff. The data collected from the interviews was used to make a ""detailed profile"" of workers, which then influenced decisions concerning their employment. 3. Tim - Telecom Italia (€27.8m/£24m)In early 2020, the Italian data protection authorities issued a mammoth €27.8m fine to telecoms firm Tim, formerly known as Telecom Italia.The fine was levied after a large number of complaints about unwanted promotional calls. Garante, the regulator, said it had received hundreds of complaints from January 2017 to early 2019.It said customers were getting nuisance calls without having given their consent - even if they had registered their telephone numbers on Italy's ""do not call"" list or explicitly told callers they were revoking consent for such calls. One person was reportedly called 155 times in a single month.The violations were several and serious, the regulator found, issuing the large fine and 20 ""corrective measures"" for the firm.4. British Airways (£20m)British Airways was fined in 2020 after users of its website were directed to a fraudulent site.Through the data breach, hackers were able to harvest the personal data of about 400,000 people. The leaked data included login and travel booking details, names, addresses and credit card information. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionBritish Airways were hit with the biggest GDPR fine to dateInitially, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it planned to fine BA £183.4m - which would have been the largest fine issued under GDPR.But more than a year later, it dramatically lowered the fine, saying ""the economic impact of Covid-19"" had been taken into account. It was still the highest fine issued by the ICO, which found that the hack was the result of British Airways' negligence. BA said it had let customers know as soon as it became aware of the problem, had fully co-operated with the investigation, and that it had ""made considerable improvements to the security of our systems since the attack"".5. Marriott International Hotels (£18.4m)British hotel chain Marriott International was fined in 2020 in relation to a hack dating back to 2014, but not uncovered until four years later. The hack exposed the personal details of about 300 million customers including credit card information, passport numbers and dates of birth. Seven million of those guest records related to people in the UK.Similar to the British Airways fine, the ICO initially said it planned to issue a much higher fine of £99m - but lowered the amount later.Where does GDPR money go?In the UK, all penalties handed out by the ICO are paid into a central government fund which belongs to the Treasury. The Consolidated Fund is the government's general bank account at the Bank of England. It was established in 1787 with the purpose of being ""one fund into which shall flow every stream of public revenue and from which shall come the supply of every service"". This means that just like tax revenue, GDPR fines are used to fund public services. The majority of other countries in the EU use a similar structure. Rob Elliss, from tech company Thales, says that despite success so far in handing out substantial fines, GDPR will face more challenges in a post-Covid world.""When GDPR was first drafted, the legislation did not necessarily account for the adoption of new technologies and rapid migration to the cloud brought on by the pandemic,"" he said. ""In this remote working era, businesses needed to digitally transform almost overnight just to keep the lights on, without necessarily incorporating security in the design of new systems and processes.""Correction 25 May 2021: An earlier version of this story contained some inaccuracies including out-of-date information about the fines imposed on British Airways and Marriott International Hotels and listing Amazon among the top five companies fined. However Amazon was not fined in connection with GDPR, but under France's separate e-privacy directive and so we have updated these figures and replaced Amazon in the list with Tim .Related TopicsGoogleAmazonGDPRMore on this storyFacebook and Instagram disable features in EuropePublished17 December 2020Twitter fined £400,000 for breaking EU data lawPublished15 December 2020Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published45 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

As far as they were aware, no-one else had access to their wi-fi at the time.They were told their devices would need to be checked for evidence and would be returned in ""a few days"" - but it was the middle of March when they finally got them all back.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionManaging without devices posed many problems for the couple during lockdownThat presented practical problems: Kate and Matthew were working from home and their children were home-schooling.""We had no way of contacting anyone other than from the landline,"" said Kate, who works as a private tutor. At the time, England was in the middle of a lockdown. Non-essential shops were shut, so there was no chance to pop out and buy new gadgets.Suicidal thoughtsBut it soon became apparent that the case was going to have a far greater impact on their lives.The police needed to unlock Matthew's work laptop, which was encrypted. He had to tell his boss about the case in order to get the decryption key.And the police had also informed social services and the children's school about the investigation, meaning Kate was suspended from her role as a governor there.When their children went back to school in March, the couple were told they were not allowed on the premises other than to drop their children off.It took a toll on their mental health.""What got to me was the not-knowing, and as the weeks went on I got more anxious,"" said Matthew, who was signed off work with stress.Kate is more blunt about the trauma: ""It was months of hell. And during it, we both had suicidal thoughts."" image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionThe couple live in a block of flats, meaning their wi-fi could have been accessed by a neighbour or someone sitting in a car outsideIn February, a conversation with a friend who worked in cyber-security alerted them to the possibility that their router, supplied by their broadband provider Vodafone, might hold clues to what had happened. They had not changed the default passwords for either the router itself or the admin webpage, leaving it susceptible to brute force attacks.""We think of ourselves as competent users but we are not IT experts,"" said Matthew. ""No-one told us to change the password and the setting up of the router didn't require us to go on to the admin menu, so we didn't."" ""It came with a password, so we plugged it in and didn't touch anything.""Ken Munro, a security consultant with Pen Test Partners, told the BBC that it can take ""a matter of minutes"" for criminals to piggyback on insecure wireless connections.""First, a hacker would need to 'crack' the wi-fi password - and if that hasn't been changed from the one written on a sticker on the side of the router, and the router is more than a year or two old - then it would take a matter of minutes to crack it,"" he saidThat would allow the hacker on to a private individual's home network - although they would have to be within about 20 metres of the house. ""Second, to do anything particularly sinister on the home network, the hacker will need to change the router configuration. That needs the router admin password,"" explained Mr Munro.image captionThe couple's router had an insecure wi-fi password, which may have been accessed by a criminal""Most people don't even know the router has an admin password, let alone change it from the one written on the side of the router.""So what I guess has happened here, is that the hacker has cracked the wi-fi password and then made changes to the router configuration, so their illicit activities on the internet appear to be coming from the innocent party.""Industry problemIn March, when the couple's devices were returned and the case closed, the police officer assigned to liaise with them seemed to corroborate that unauthorised use of their wi-fi was to blame. But it couldn't be proved.The couple submitted a subject access request to Vodafone, to see if they could find evidence that there had been unauthorised use of their wi-fi. The case remains on file, including on their children's school records, and they want closure.Vodafone told them that it did not have a record of their internet activity. It has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.The router was several years old. The HHG2500 model in question has been highlighted as having a weak default password in a recent report by Which? into security issues around older routers.The problem is industry-wide, points out Mr Munro.""Internet service providers have started to improve matters to make these attacks harder, by putting unique passwords on each router. However, it will take years for all of the offending routers to be replaced,"" he said.Doing so costs money - which could be another reason it has taken so long, he adds.The government plans to ban default passwords being pre-set on devices, as part of upcoming legislation covering smart devices.Kate Bevan, Which? computing editor, said the new laws needed to be introduced ""as soon as possible, and backed by strong enforcement"".Meanwhile, internet service providers needed to ""encourage their customers to upgrade devices that pose security risks"" and consumers should set ""strong, unique passwords"" for their routers.For Kate and Matthew, it has been a tough learning curve.""It was devastating for us. And because there's no evidence about how this took place, whoever is responsible for this awful crime totally got away with it.""UNIQUE STAYCATIONS: Forgotten spaces are turned into one of a kind rural retreatsWHEN DID HISTORICAL EVENTS HAPPEN?: Take our mind-boggling time quiz to find out!Related TopicsVodafoneCyber-attacksMore on this storyMillions at risk of hacking from old routersPublished6 MayTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published48 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Apple v Epic: Tim Cook appears on the stand in Epic legal row - BBC News,"Apple v Epic: Tim Cook appears on the stand in Epic legal row - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechApple v Epic: Tim Cook appears on the stand in Epic legal rowPublished21 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightEpic Games/EPAimage captionEpic makes Fortnite and its colourful characters - but is at odds with Apple boss Tim CookApple boss Tim Cook took the witness stand for the first time in his company's major legal battle with Epic Games over an alleged monopoly. Epic, maker of the hit video game Fortnite, claims Apple's tight control over iPhone apps hurts competition. During his appearance, Mr Cook argued that keeping control of the App Store helped keep iPhones secure.He also said he did not know if the App Store made a profit, telling the court Apple did not break down the figures.Facing questions about the level of profit the App Store generates from the 30% commission it takes on sales, he said: ""We don't have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store.""Instead, he said that he had a ""feeling"" that it was profitable - but could not share figures with the court. Mr Cook was being questioned about his oversight of top-level decisions around the App Store's policies.Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also questioned Mr Cook, asking about a survey that showed 39% of developers are dissatisfied with the app store.Wow, the Epic-Apple judge is currently pressing Tim Cook harder than Epic's lawyers did. And they didn't go easy. She's pushing him on whether they truly face competition, pushing him that a survey showed 39% of devs dissatisfied with app distribution. ""How is that acceptable?""— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) May 21, 2021
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterMr Cook said he was not familiar with the survey but said there was a ""friction"" because Apple rejected 40% of apps weekly.The judge also asked him if he was a gamer, to which he admitted that he was not. Mr Cook's opposite number in the case - Epic Games chief Tim Sweeney - has already appeared on the stand in the opening days of the long-running legal battle. What is the case about?Two main things are at the centre of the case: the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app purchases, and the fact that no other app stores are allowed to exist on the iPhone and iPad to offer an alternative. Epic's Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world and makes its money through in-game purchases of character costumes and other digital items.  A 30% cut on millions of such purchases adds up to a lot - but Apple's rules forbid the company from circumventing its payment methods if a sale is made in the iPhone app. media captionEpic Games v Apple: What is going on?In August last year, Fortnite offered players a 20% discount if they paid Epic Games directly, in direct violation of Apple's rules. Apple quickly removed the app from its store - as did Google, which enforces a similar policy.Epic had clearly expected that to happen. The firm immediately launched a PR blitz to mobilise its fanbase and win support, painting Apple as a dominating force suppressing freedom of choice. Within hours, Epic lodged prepared legal complaints in the US against both Apple and Google. But the debate goes beyond the 30% cut, to wider questions about competitiveness. Epic has made no secret of the fact that it would like to run its own app stores on both iOS and Android, avoiding Apple's and Google's payment and delivery systems entirely. This was Tim Cook's first time giving evidence at trial. There's no video footage of the court case but journalists can listen in to a terrible audio line that sounds like the trial is taking place under water. It's therefore hard to get a feel for the atmosphere of court. Still, it's pretty clear that Mr Cook is having a tough day. I'm used to hearing him asked questions in Congress. Usually he has a relaxed air - it takes a lot to get him flustered. However a cross examination in court is a very different beast. Grilled by an expert legal team, Mr Cook appeared more evasive. He was asked, for example, how much profit Apple makes from its App Store. He replied that he didn't know. Considering the App Store is a massive money spinner for Apple, that is a surprise. Google also pays a huge amount to Apple to have its search preloaded onto iPhones. Asked about this deal (believed to be worth around $10bn, or £7bn) Mr Cook didn't seem to know much about it, unable - or unwilling - to confirm how much this contract was worth. Mr Cook may be reluctant to unveil commercially sensitive data. However, he came across as vague on detail. And that's not a good look when you're giving evidence in court. Most experts believe this is Apple's to lose but anti-trust cases are notoriously difficult to predict.And we're unlikely to get a judgement soon - there is a lot of evidence the judge has to wade through.What has happened so far?The legal cases against Apple and Google are separate, and Apple has been the first in court.Apple is accused of running a monopoly, subjecting all apps to a cumbersome review process, and rejecting them for all sorts of reasons. Epic contends that is unfair, while Apple says it protects customers from dodgy apps. Much of the early debate has been over definitions, with Epic arguing that Fortnite is more than a game, but rather a ""metaverse"" within which all sorts of experiences - including concerts and film screenings - are held. But outside of the wrangling over technical definitions, there have also been some significant revelations.The fact that Epic's model for its app store is not yet profitable is one of Apple's arguments against allowing an open system. Documents have revealed that Epic has made heavy losses with game giveaways, which cost it millions of dollars. However, in return it has gained millions of new users for its PC gaming platform - the Epic Games store - which Epic says was always its strategy. It has also emerged that Apple has debated lowering the 30% cut it takes in response to competition, with App Store chief Phil Schiller writing to Steve Jobs as long ago as 2011. And one particularly memorable exchange was born out of a debate over adult content. 'It's just a banana ma'am'Apple had highlighted that Epic's store hosted a store-within-a-store - Itch.io - which sells adult content. Apple gave this as an example of why it did not want third-party stores on its platforms. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionAn actor dressed as Fortnite's Peely the banana characterLater, while showing images of Fortnite, Apple's legal team referred to Peely, a Fortnite character who is a banana.It showed him in a tuxedo, remarking: ""We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning."" On cross-examination, Epic's attorney wanted to put to bed the ""implication"" that a naked banana might be inappropriate, resulting in Epic's marketing boss informing the court: ""It's just a banana, ma'am.""

But that means 90% of them were still slipping through the net. What is it about dating apps that fosters this toxicity? Perhaps pitting people against one another in an ""attractiveness Hunger Games"", based on their photographs, is part of the problem.But that is a lucrative game for Tinder, which charges £116 a year for unlimited swiping of its ""top picks"" - an algorithmically curated list of the most in-demand members on the app.Related TopicsTinderSocial mediaDating appsOnline datingMore on this storyInstagram now asks bullies: 'Are you sure?'Published8 July 2019Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published48 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The new spectacles are an evolution from that idea, letting lens creators project their creations onto the world around them. Previous versions of Spectacles were focused on cameras for capturing content - the AR display is new to this latest release. Examples which the company showcased included a digital projection of neon sea creatures on a real-world beach, an art gallery projected onto the street, and a guided tour with enhanced visuals of a landscape.Tapping the vast potential of @Snap’s AR platform, the next generation of Spectacles allow you to overlay Lenses directly onto the world in front of you, for an immersive AR experience. #SnapPartnerSummithttps://t.co/r4XnSC886z pic.twitter.com/UTDDoxwBOO— Spectacles (@Spectacles) May 20, 2021
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterOn the inside, the new tech has two cameras, four microphones and stereo speakers, and is powered by a chip specifically tuned for AR and VR. But it only has a 30-minute battery life.For now, they remain available only upon application by creators of Snapchat lenses, using the company's Lens Studio desktop software, a tool for creating 3D-modelled AR experiences.That strategy of limited release is not new. The first version of Spectacles was released by Snap Inc, the company behind Snapchat, through limited pop-up vending machines which helped create a marketing buzz around the idea.It later sold them as a regular product online - but after a year, the first version had hit Snap Inc's finances to the tune of $40m (£30m). That led to comparisons to Google's failed ""smart glasses"" experiment, Google Glass.media captionWATCH: Rory tries Snap SpectaclesHugely popular That did not stop Snap Inc - which calls itself a camera company - from sticking with the project. The latest AR innovation is the fourth version of Spectacles.""Spectacles are the next step in Snap's journey to reinvent the camera,"" the company said in a press release.""The new Spectacles bring imagination to life in a natural way—with our eyes looking out at the world in front of us.""Snapchat does not receive the same level of attention as other social media networks such as Facebook or Twitter, but it remains hugely popular. The company now reports that it has 500 million monthly active users.Leo Gebbie, an analyst with CCS Insight, said the new spectacles were ""ambitious"".""The Spectacles represent a staging post on the gradual journey to smartglasses, even if the decision to restrict their availability shows that they aren't consumer-ready just yet,"" he said.AR devices are getting ""slimmer, lighter and more powerful"", he said.""However, we're still years away from the 'holy grail' of a device which looks no different from normal eyewear, and there are lots of challenges to be overcome in device engineering and design.""While still not ready for general sale, ""it should spur the development of innovative and exciting new uses,"" he added.Related TopicsSnapchatMixed realityGoogleSocial mediaMore on this storySnapchat loses $40m on flop SpectaclesPublished8 November 2017Snapchat launches sunglasses with cameraPublished24 September 2016Snapchat spectacles 'livestream' surgeryPublished14 December 2016Snapchat to pay users $1m a day for viral hitsPublished23 November 2020Snapchat boss: US faces ‘century of competition’Published30 December 2020US teen's Snapchat rant reaches Supreme CourtPublished26 AprilTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published46 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

""Later, the doctor called back and verified symptoms and sent the person to testing, which means that there was no risk that sick people gathered in doctors' offices and spread the virus.""And it seemed to work - until it didn't. Throughout most of 2020, Estonia's Covid-19 cases and deaths remained at very low levels, among the best in Europe. Then, as the winter arrived, they began to take off - and by February ""we did go at one point to the top of the tables in Europe,"" the president admits.So what went wrong? ""People want to be together,"" she explains. The virus spread most  quickly among 20-24-year-olds.""They have all the digital skills, many of them work in jobs which allow distant working, but you know, having a glass of wine on Zoom - this didn't really work very well.""Who wants a digital vaccine passport?Bye-bye Silicon Valley?Big Tech and the future of workEstonia has the spring outbreak under control, and in the league table of Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 Estonia is below the UK and Germany. But it has a far higher death rate than Asian hi-tech countries such as South Korea and Taiwan.One explanation may be that while Estonia's government is, in theory, collecting vast amounts of the kind of data that would allow it to track its citizens and the progress of the virus precisely, it is also keen to guarantee their privacy.""The  Estonian government has promised its citizens that it is not looking into the data unless citizens give their permission,"" President Kaljulaid says.Meanwhile, South Korea used data from credit cards, CCTV and mobile phone masts to track people infected with the virus, and the Taiwanese police monitored phone locations to make sure people stayed in quarantine, and came knocking on their doors when their batteries went flat. Such a level of surveillance would not be acceptable in Estonia, or in many other Western countries.More evidence, then, that technology is not a silver bullet in the fight against the virus - much depends on the context in which it is used and the norms of human behaviour. Young Estonians may be digitally savvy and well-informed about how the virus spreads, but they would still rather meet for a drink face-to-face than stare at a webcam in yet another Zoom encounter.Related TopicsEstoniaCoronavirus pandemicFlexible workingMore on this storyTech Tent: Controlling coronavirus with appsPublished13 March 2020Tech Tent: What can we learn from South Korea?Published15 May 2020Tech Tent: Bye-bye Silicon Valley?Published16 AprilTech Tent: Who wants a digital vaccine passport?Published4 December 2020Tech Tent: Big Tech and the future of workPublished4 September 2020Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published46 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Twitter finds racial bias in image-cropping AI - BBC News,"Twitter finds racial bias in image-cropping AI - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechTwitter finds racial bias in image-cropping AIPublished20 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionPreferences for white people over black people and women over men were found in testingTwitter's automatic cropping of images had underlying issues that favoured white individuals over black people, and women over men, the company said. It comes months after its users highlighted potential problems with the algorithm, which cropped large photos. The social network's follow-up research has now confirmed the problem. Twitter said it has already started phasing out the older system, with an update to mobile apps that gave more accurate image previews.Under the old system, the algorithm would do its best to centre the view of very tall or wide images in a way that would frame people's faces or other interesting parts of the image. But it did not always work perfectly. Racial biasIn September last year, a university employee noticed that when he posted two photos - one of himself and one of a colleague - Twitter's preview consistently showed the white man over the black man, no matter which photo was added to the tweet first. Other users discovered the pattern held true for images of former US President Barack Obama and Senator Mitch McConnnell, or for stock images of businessmen of difference racial backgrounds. When both were in the same image, the preview crop appeared to favour white faces, hiding the black faces until users clicked through to the full photo.Twitter investigates racial bias in image previewsThe algorithms that make decisions about your lifeTwitter reacted quickly, explaining that it had tested for these kinds of problems with its machine learning system before releasing it - but acknowledged that more work had to be done, and promised a fix. The company revealed the results in a detailed engineering blog post on Wednesday. The problem was with its ""saliency algorithm"" which it released in 2018 to crop images. The algorithm was ""trained on human eye-tracking data"", Twitter explained, but the cause of the apparent issues may be down to several complicated factors.In testing, compared to a 50-50 chance of ""demographic parity"", it found: An 8% difference in favour of women over men A 4% difference favouring white people over black people of both sexes A 7% difference favouring white women over black women A 2% difference in favour of white men over black menThe team also tested for allegations of the ""male gaze"" effect - where images of women were cropped to the chest or legs rather than a face. But in that instance, the test they ran did not find evidence of bias. ""We considered the trade-offs between the speed and consistency of automated cropping with the potential risks we saw in this research,"" wrote Rumman Chowdhury, Twitter's director of software engineering. ""One of our conclusions is that not everything on Twitter is a good candidate for an algorithm, and in this case, how to crop an image is a decision best made by people,"" she said. Today we’re launching a test to a small group on iOS and Android to give people an accurate preview of how their images will appear when they Tweet a photo. pic.twitter.com/cxu7wv3Khs— Dantley Davis (@dantley) March 10, 2021
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterShe pointed to the recent rollout of a true-to-life crop preview, which also no longer crops ""standard"" 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio photos.  ""We're working on further improvements to media on Twitter that builds on this initial effort, and we hope to roll it out to everyone soon,"" she said. In a statement to CNN, a Twitter spokesperson clarified that while the initial change was on mobile apps - where the problem was first reported - the company plans to remove the algorithmic cropping from the website version of Twitter in the coming months.

In a separate post dealing with questions, Microsoft clarified that there would be some exceptions to the retirement, including on older versions of Windows.Between 2000 and 2005, Internet Explorer enjoyed a 90% market share (Google Chrome is the most used browser today). But in 2013 Microsoft was fined €561m ($731m; £484m at the time) for failing to promote alternative browsers within its Windows operating system.It had introduced a ""browser choice"" pop-up in 2010, but the feature was dropped in an update the following year. Microsoft said this had happened by mistake.New fontThe tech giant is also tinkering with another bit of history: in April this year it announced that it is planning to change its default font, which has been Calibri across all of its products since 2007.It is inviting users to vote on their favourite from five contenders, and says the most popular will form its new look.Related TopicsInternetMicrosoftMore on this storyMicrosoft ends Windows 7: What should you do?Published13 January 2020Microsoft issues emergency fix for IE browserPublished24 September 2019Top StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published49 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Elon Musk UK visit drives Tesla factory rumours - BBC News,"Elon Musk UK visit drives Tesla factory rumours - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechElon Musk UK visit drives Tesla factory rumoursPublished20 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesA brief visit by Tesla boss Elon Musk to Luton has ignited rumours that he is considering a Tesla factory in the UK.The electric car mogul flew into Luton Airport on a private jet last weekend and stayed two days, reports say.The Daily Telegraph reports that the visit coincides with a hunt by UK officials for ""a major new car plant"" location.The secrecy around the bids has led to speculation that Mr Musk may be involved.The Telegraph reported (behind a paywall) that regional authorities - including those in Teesside and the West Midlands - were given an unusually short 48 hours to prepare bids for a 250-hectare site, without being told what company the bid was for.The process was run by the Office for Investment, a new government office which is designed to help smooth out discussions between the public sector and private foreign investors post-Brexit.Flight-tracking software showed that a private Gulfstream jet widely reported to belong to Mr Musk, landed at Luton Airport from California.The plane then moved on to Germany, where Mr Musk paid a visit on Monday to the site of Tesla's large ""gigafactory"", which has been plagued by delays.However, neither the government nor Tesla have confirmed the speculation about Mr Musk's brief stop in the UK. It's also not the first time Mr Musk has landed in Luton for a brief visit, fuelling such rumours - he was reported to have made a similar stop in June last year.For Elon Musk, Luton Airport - with its private terminal for corporate jets - may be just a handy place for a brief stop on his way to inspect his German operations. But for a UK government desperate to boost inward investment, the stopovers - and there have been several - are a vital opportunity to woo the Tesla tycoon.Two years ago he made it clear that Brexit uncertainty was a factor in rejecting the UK and choosing Berlin as the location for Tesla's ""gigafactory"", which the company bills as ""the most advanced high-volume electric vehicle production plant in the world"".But British officials have not given up, stressing that outside the EU those pesky state aid rules don't apply, meaning there could be substantial government funding for a factory here.Now it's still hard to see the logic for a Tesla plant  just to supply the UK market - but Elon Musk has shown himself to be adept at taking advantage of government subsidies and tax breaks at home in the US, as well as in Germany. So don't rule it out quite yet.Related TopicsElectric carsCar industryElon MuskTeslaMore on this story'Berlin rocks,' says Elon Musk as he picks factoryPublished13 November 2019Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin, says Elon MuskPublished13 MayCrashed Tesla's autopilot was off, says reportPublished11 MayTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published50 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

Law-enforcement agenciesRansomware attacks prevent victims accessing computer systems or data until a ransom is paid. Law-enforcement agencies around the world are increasingly urging victims not to pay.But paying ransoms is not illegal.And many organisations pay in secret.Now, the Ransomware Task Force (RTF) global coalition of cyber-experts is lobbying governments to take action. It has made nearly 50 recommendations to curb the crime spree but couldn't agree over whether countries should ban ransom payments.And we asked two members why.'Banning payments would result in a pretty horrific game of 'chicken''Rapid7 community and public affairs vice-president Jen Ellis says: ""Most people agree, in an ideal world, the government would prohibit paying ransoms. ""Since ransomware is a profit-motivated crime, this would hopefully discourage the crime altogether.""And no-one would be faced with funding organised crime. ""The problem is, we don't live in an ideal world. ""In the world we do live in, banning payments would almost certainly result in a pretty horrific game of 'chicken', whereby criminals would shift all their focus towards organisations which are least likely to be able to deal with downtime - for example hospitals, water-treatment plants, energy providers, and schools. ""The hackers may expect the harm to society caused by this downtime to apply the necessary pressure to ensure they get paid. ""They have very little to lose by doing this - and potentially a big payday to gain. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionTravelex reportedly paid REvil hackers more than $2m in Bitcoin, after a January 2020 ransomware attack""Let's say the government creates a fund to support these organisations so they don't have to pay. ""If that happens, the attackers could then just switch their focus to small businesses and non-profit organisations which don't have the resources to protect themselves. ""They could face complete ruin if they don't pay. ""Faced with declaring bankruptcy, these organisations may consider making a payment in secret, which would then place them even further at the mercy of the criminals, who could threaten to publicise it. ""Overcoming these problems is not straightforward. ""It will take time, education, and sustained investment. ""Prohibiting payments is a great goal to shoot for.""But we must be pragmatic in our approach to ensure we do not create significant economic and societal harm.""media captionBusinesses are being held to ransom by callous cyber-criminals'A payment ban would take some burden off organisations'Cyber Threat Alliance president and chief executive Michael Daniel says: ""The case for prohibiting ransom payments is clear.""Ransomware attacks are primarily motivated by profit.""And without profit, attackers will shift away from this tactic. ""Further, ransom profits are used to fund other, even more dangerous crime, such as human trafficking, child exploitation, and terrorism. ""Finally, payments beget more attacks, reinforcing the tactic's utility.    ""No organisation wants to pay a ransom. ""Instead, they feel they have no choice, whether it's due to the threat of insolvency, reputational damage stemming from service interruptions, or the potential for loss of life or wide-scale economic disruption. ""Indeed, from a purely short-term, organisational viewpoint, paying a ransom is often an economically rational decision.   image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionGarmin reportedly paid about $10m to Evil Corp ransomware hackers, in August 2020""We need to break this cycle and deprive the ransomware ecosystem of 'fuel'. ""A payment ban would take some burden off organisations, by removing payment as a legal possibility.  ""As a result, well designed prohibitions would provide targeted organisations with leverage to push back against their attackers.  ""Such prohibitions should not be implemented immediately.""in fact, such bans should only be put in place after governments have established effective victim-support mechanisms. ""Payment prohibitions should be part of a broad-based campaign to improve prevention, deterrence, disruption, and response. ""Those arguing against bans make an excellent point about the potential heavy cost organisations attacked during a transition period could face, potentially even going out of business or facing enormous pressure to restore service. ""Therefore, for payment bans to achieve their intended effect, governments will have to provide companies with the resources and support to withstand these attacks.""Related TopicsCyber-crimeCyber-securityCyber-attacksHackingtonComputer hackingTop StoriesDozens dead amid historic Canada heatwaveThe country has recorded its highest ever temperature - 49.6C (121.3F) - for the third day in a row.Published50 minutes agoUS army 'days away' from completing Afghan pull-outPublished3 hours agoN Korea sees 'grave incident' after Covid lapsesPublished11 hours agoFeaturesAstronomy photo competition shortlist revealedWhy is the Miami rescue effort taking so long?‘Jail is a brutal dehumanising place’Sausages, riots and the Northern Ireland Protocol.

""Normally, it would take the whole evening. “We live over 20 miles from school so [it is] 30 minutes in the car each way.""And even though there is an appointment system, things rarely run to time.” Online lessonsSir Kevan also pushed for schools to move towards online exams and lessons.""We need to move more quickly to assess online because I think that is the future,” he said. “So a good example would be many schools now create online lessons that you can just flip between school and home - and you actually extend the experience.” Children in England had missed about 115 days of face-to-face schooling during the pandemic, the committee heard.And technology had become “woven into the fabric” of education.LOCKDOWN RULES: What are they and when will they end?SOCIAL DISTANCING: How can I meet my friend safely?

They've become a divisive topic among Twitch users in recent months.But swimwear is explicitly permitted under Twitch's own rules.Amouranth alleged she had been ""targeted"" because her content ""is not advertiser friendly"".It is the latest landmark in a long-running row over so-called ""hot tub streamers"" and their high profile on Amazon-owned Twitch, which traditionally focused on game-streaming content. Twitch allows anyone over the age of 13 to use the service, and is popular among teenagers.But much of the criticism has sexist overtones, with disparaging slang used for female streamers based on what they wear, or claims that some streams amount to ""softcore porn"".""An alarming precedent""Amouranth - whose real name is Kaitlyn Siragusa - said Twitch had indefinitely suspended advertising on her channel, without any notice, or warning that she was breaking any rules.""Twitch didn't reach out in any way whatsoever,"" she said in a series of tweets, adding that she only found out about the change when she noticed ad revenue had disappeared.""This is an alarming precedent and serves as a stark warning that although content may not ostensibly break community guidelines or terms of service, Twitch has complete discretion to target individual channels and partially or wholly demonetize them for content that is deemed 'not advertiser friendly',"" she said.'OnlyFans is ripping me off by capping prices'Twitch apologises for using 'womxn' after backlashBut ""there is no known policy for what results in a streamer being put on this blacklist"", she added.Twitch policies say that ""sexually suggestive content"" is banned, but its examples include suggestive camera framing, groping certain body parts, or ""erotic dances, such as those involving stripping"".In a stream on Wednesday after the ban, Amouranth told her viewers that her ad revenue ""was making me $30,000 a month"", and was much higher than the amount she received from direct donations from viewers.image copyrightAmouranth / TwitchGaming news site Kotaku, which has been reporting on the hot tub controversy for months, reported that Twitch has never demonetised a streamer this way before, and that this move sets a new precedent for the site.The topic has been debated by both streamers and their viewers, with some fearing that sexually suggestive content such as hot tub streams could make Twitch a less attractive platform for advertisers, and thus hurt earnings across the board.In a stream in April, Amouranth said: ""I will agree, long-term, [it is] probably damaging for Twitch's ad revenue. However, if they allow it, they allow it, you know? It's their choice. It is what it is.""Advertising is only paid to Twitch streamers who are part of its partner programme, which it can remove people from at any time. The site can also suspend accounts ""at any time for any conduct that we determine to be inappropriate or harmful"".But neither of those sanctions appear to have been used in this case.The site had already re-drawn its rules on sexually suggestive content and partial nudity last year, after a years-long similar row over women's cleavage on live streams.Twitch has been contacted for comment on Amouranth's advertising suspension.Related TopicsAdvertisingGamingTwitchStreamingMore on this story'OnlyFans is ripping me off by capping prices'Published1 September 2020Twitch apologises for using 'womxn' after backlashPublished2 MarchCalls for Twitch to cut sexual contentPublished9 December 2017Top StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published9 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published4 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

Google I/O was back this year with several new announcements. Here are the things that caught our eye. More inclusive cameraGoogle says it is creating a smartphone camera that more accurately depicts skin tone. ""For people of colour, photography has not always seen us as we want to be seen, even in some of our own Google products"" said Google's Sameer Samat.Google says it's making changes to auto white balance adjustments ""to bring out natural brown tones"". The company says it is also working on new algorithms to better distinguish the subject from a background. The camera will be ready on the new Google Pixel which will be out later this year. However Google has itself been subject to accusations of racism recently.The company was described as ""institutionally racist"" by influential AI academic Timnit Gebru. She says she was dismissed by the company after a paper she had written about discrimination in AI in December. More details here.AI-curated albumsGoogle Photos will use AI to curate collections to share with the user, similar to Memories on Apple and Facebook. A big complaint from users of Apple's or Facebook's feature is when people are reminded of breakups or tough times in their lives.image copyrightGoogleGoogle says they have taken this into consideration and will allow users to control which photos they do or don't see by letting them remove specific images, people or time periods.  Another feature they're introducing is called ""little patterns"". It will use AI to scan pictures and create albums based on similarities within them - for example, the same jumper, the same couch or similar cups of coffee.Google is also using machine learning to create what they're calling ""cinematic moments"" which will look at two or three pictures taken within moments of each other and creating a moving image, similar to Apple's Live Photos. Inclusive languageGoogle launched a new feature called ""Smart Canvas"" - a sort of umbrella platform interconnecting Google Docs, Meet, Sheets, Tasks, and Slides.One feature announced is an ""assisted writing"" tool. This will flag up ""gendered terms"" to the user and suggest alternatives. For example, a user who wrote ""Chairman"" would be asked whether they wanted to use a gendered term - and would be offered alternatives such as ""Chairperson"" or ""Chair"". image copyrightGoogleGoogle said more details would be revealed ""in the coming weeks"". Android 12Google described this update to its operating system, Android 12, as ""the biggest design change in Android's history"". This update will include new privacy features that will allow users to have more control over how much information apps get from them. A light on the top of the screen will indicate if an app is using the device's camera or microphone - a feature users of Apple's iOS are already familiar with. image copyrightGoogleimage captionAndroid 12 can create colour palettes that compliments the background imageUsers can also opt to share an approximate location instead of an exact one. Google and Apple have recently faced criticism about their operating systems. The two companies run the operating systems of the vast majority of the world's phones outside of China.  Apple recently announced a new feature to its iOS update that allows users to stop third party apps from tracking them. Google didn't announce an equivalent tool. 3D video conferencing Google announced it was working on a new video chat system - where the person you're chatting to appears in front of you in 3D. The project is called ""Starline"" and aims to create ultra realistic projections for video chats. The pandemic has created huge interest in how video conferencing can be improved. image copyrightGoogleimage captionGoogle's Project Starline uses 3D imaging to make someone on a video call appear as if they're really there.However before you get too excited, this is still very much a work in progress. The technology needs multiple cameras, and is unlikely to be compatible with consumer tech anytime soon.

Google views this AI as better than searching for the information yourself, rather than a substitute for medical advice. Whether people use it like that is another matter - we already know the internet is a source of both medical panic and false reassurance. How people might use the AI has fed into a design that aims to prioritise safety. Medical tools like this, yes even those with an AI at the helm, have to strike a balance. Do you focus on catching everyone who has a disease or on ruling out those who are healthy to avoid unnecessary worry or treatments? One always comes at the cost of the other. The doctors and developers involved told me the AI has been optimised to avoid missing ""alarming or scary"" conditions such as skin cancer. The flip side is some people will be advised to check out something that will turn out to be benign.

The FTC says losses to fraudsters who claim to be Musk or other famous people are up almost 1,000% on 2019/20. Such scams often begin as investment tips on online message boards.These ""tips"" lure people onto fake investment websites.The scammers often impersonate well-known personalities on Twitter by copying their profile pictures and choosing usernames very similar to those on the genuine accounts.They then post replies to popular tweets made by the genuine celebrity to give their messages prominence on Twitter.The FTC said people pretending to be Mr Musk alone made more than $2m in the six months from October.Creating fake profiles contravenes Twitter's policy against deceptive accounts, but according to tech news website The Verge, ""Twitter's moderators have struggled to rein in the activity, and it remains prevalent on the platform.""

""And why were there so many willing participants in such a pointless act of deception? ""It doesn't make any sense.”Malicious softwareThe cyber-attack was discovered in December but had been in operation for months before.Hackers used US company SolarWinds’ Orion platform to target US government departments, about 100 private companies and small numbers of UK organisations. But nearly 18,000 customers had installed the malicious software.media captionRussia's spy chief Sergei Naryshkin gives BBC News a rare interview about the SolarWinds cyber-attackAsked if the SVR had been responsible, Mr Naryshkin said he could not ""claim the creative achievements of others as his own"".""These claims are like a bad detective novel,"" he told BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg.Mr Naryshkin then quoted from documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden to suggest the tactics of the attack were similar to those used by US and British intelligence agencies.“I don’t want to assert that this cyber-attack was carried out by a US agency - but the tactics are similar,” he said.And accusations Russia was involved in cyber-attacks, poisonings, hacks, or meddling in elections were “absurd” and “pathetic”.Russia’s spy chief also revealed contact had been re-established with the head of Britain's secret intelligence service MI6, adding he hoped for a face-to-face meeting soon.Countries hack each other all the time - for information, influence and intimidation.Most cyber-campaigns go unreported, with wins and losses chalked up on secret boards by rival intelligence agencies.But SolarWinds was different.Not only was it a big loss for the US, it also broke out of top-secret circles.The consensus in the cyber-security world is the hack falls squarely in the ""fair game"" category of cyber-spying.But the disruption and embarrassment it caused is unprecedented.Some of the biggest technology companies and cyber-defenders in the world were breached and high levels of US government accessed.We will never know what secrets the hackers were able to steal or how deep they delved.What we do know from this interview is the cyber-attack followed a familiar pattern - the West accuses Russia of the hack, Russia laughs it off and organisations spend millions more on their cyber-security defences, hoping it will never happen again.Related TopicsRussiaCyber-securityComputer hackingGCHQMore on this storyMore US government agencies hackedPublished15 December 2020SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack mattersPublished16 December 2020Russia spy chief suggests West behind cyber-attackPublished18 MayRussia behind major cyber-attack, says PompeoPublished19 December 2020Top StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published10 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published4 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

""I was completely astonished when I saw the bill,"" said John Carr, Secretary of the Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety.""Pornhub, xHamster, all of the big commercial pornography sites - the largest single source of pornography in the world - are outside the scope of the bill or could easily put themselves outside of the scope of the bill."".They could do so by easily removing all user-uploaded content, he said - as Pornhub recently did within days of an investigation being launched into its user-generated content.""They could do that and it would not affect their core business model in any way, shape or form,"" Mr Carr said. Proposals to make all UK pornography users confirm their age before accessing explicit content was first mooted in 2016.It was made law in the 2017 Digital Economy Act - but that was never brought into force after repeated delays, and fears it would not work.  It was officially dropped in 2019, but the government pledged ""other measures"" would achieve the same results.Government lays out plans to protect users onlineFather calls for proof of age on pornography sitesChildren as young as seven 'stumble' on porn""A strong case""Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told a meeting of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee that the Online Safety Bill was designed to deal with social media sites, where he believed the biggest risk with pornography was ""kids stumbling across it"". He also suggested that most commercial porn sites ""do have user-generated content on them, so most of them will be in scope"". But he left the door open to firm up the rules.""I don't have a closed mind on this. If we could find a commensurate way of providing wider protection for children within it... I think there is a strong case for doing that,"" Mr Dowden said. image copyrightPA Mediaimage captionOliver Dowden suggested he was open to ""hanging"" age checks on the ""Christmas tree"" of online safety""Companies hosting user-generated content, video-sharing or live-streaming will need to prove to an independent regulator they can stop children accessing harmful content,"" a spokeswoman for DCMS said. ""Our new laws will therefore go further than the Digital Economy Act,"" she added.""Tactical move""John Carr said there were ""two scurrilous rumours"" circulating about the omission; that either it was a tactical move by the government, or that the authorities simply did not want to enforce it.But Baroness Floella Benjamin, a House of Lords member who has campaigned on issues around pornography, said she believes parliamentary review will ""add back the essential elements"" of the older law.""It was obvious that adult sites would simply drop interactive functionality to evade age verification,"" she said. Over 5yrs ago spoke in @UKHouseofLords about sexual abuse on girls in schools by boys who performed what they saw on porn sites.

We believe Brexit and Covid made the government put it to one side,"" the group said.After the years of back-and-forth, most companies have been set up to handle it - ""but we think that some businesses are pleased it's not in yet,"" it added.The Age Verification Providers Association, which represents firms providing the technology, said it interpreted Mr Dowden's comments as having ""agreed to accept an amendment... to extend it to commercial pornographic websites"". It also said that the Online Safety Bill has greater commitments to privacy, which would benefit age verification systems.It’s fair to say that it’s been a bumpy journey but it does now appear that we are approaching the right destination.

Why is Huawei still in the UK? - BBC News,"Why is Huawei still in the UK? - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechWhy is Huawei still in the UK?By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporterPublished17 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesIt's not just the unseasonally cold weather that's creating a somewhat chilly climate for Huawei's UK operations.It's been banned from the UK's 5G infrastructure and it faces ongoing scrutiny from the National Cyber Security Centre over its security practices, and whether it has links with the Chinese government, which it denies.On a consumer level, its handset sales have plummeted all over Europe since the US introduced a trade ban, which makes them incompatible with essential Google apps, including Gmail, Google Maps and the Play Store.And yet while you or I might have got our coats and left by now, Huawei remains. Not only is it still here, it's still investing in the UK - creating jobs, and funding university research.It insists its reasons are altruistic - that it takes pride in its collaborative work here and admires UK innovation - and says it gains in return valuable research insight into the future direction of the telecoms industry.It is speaking out following a slew of negative press about its associations with some of the country's top academic institutions - which have a tendency to keep quiet about their connections.Critics say universities should not be accepting its cash. But plenty are. Huawei says it has ""partnerships"" with 35 UK universities including Imperial College London, Surrey, Cambridge and Southampton. It also has its own in-house research and development centres in Bristol, Ipswich and Edinburgh, and two in Cambridge, and says it has spent an annual average of £80m over the last ten years on UK-based research in general.Part of the issue is that these partnerships are shrouded in secrecy. Journalists like me regularly get research news from universities, and academics are often keen to trumpet who has sponsored their latest breakthrough, in order to maintain their funding. This is not so common when that funding comes from Huawei, and it makes some in government uneasy.""These quiet ongoing partnerships between British universities and Chinese state-backed companies must be more transparent,"" said MP Tom Tugendhat, who co-runs the China Research Group.""Universities need to think hard about who they choose to partner with.""Huawei denies any links with the Chinese state.'Due diligence'Oxford University suspended new donations and sponsorships with Huawei in 2019 but I contacted three universities known to have ongoing relationships with the firm.Southampton University told me it had a ""strategic corporate partnership"" with Huawei but did not spell out what it was.Edinburgh said its collaboration focused on ""new technologies in data management and information technology"" and added that it had ""undergone a rigorous process of due diligence"".Cambridge did not respond.Huawei insists that it doesn't mind the lack of publicity. It's not unusual for collaborators to sign non-disclosure agreements because of the confidential nature of research, it says.It adds that it doesn't want intellectual property either - despite a keen interest in patents, it says it hardly ever takes ownership of the research from universities who make discoveries with its co-operation.It's not even after the brain power - while it ""sometimes"" employs UK university graduates, the affable Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK Vice-President, says he can't recall poaching any UK-based professors.""We are proud of our partnerships with universities and we wish for those partnerships to continue,""  he says.Mr Zhang gives me three reasons why Huawei UK remains:there is still Huawei kit in legacy broadband infrastructure, largely belonging to BT and Vodafone, which it says needs maintainingit is ""proud"" of its UK partnershipsit ""admires"" the UK's innovation and corporate social responsibilities in areas such as climate change research ""We give universities money, technology and platforms for research,"" he says, ""and we take awareness of the direction of the future.""Mr Zhang insists the firm is ""not buying something"" with its largesse, and that to think that it is, is a ""misunderstanding"".image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionFormer Science Minister Jo Johnson believes China research partnerships need to be maintained.Tom Tugendhat argues that funding from China ""rarely comes without strings attached"".Perhaps Huawei is playing the long game, hoping that one day all of the controversy will melt away, there will be a new threat to focus on, and it can resume business as usual.Certainly the UK has not cooled on all Chinese relationships, and economically, it's clear why. The number of Chinese students at UK universities has more than trebled since 2006, according to the National Institute of Economics and Social Research.Tuition fees from Chinese students add up to at least £1.7bn a year across universities and independent schools.And at an event last week, former science minister Jo Johnson said that the number of UK-China research partnerships has ballooned from 750 in 2000 to 16,000 in 2020, although he acknowledged that universities could ""better organise themselves"" in terms of the contracts they negotiate, served perhaps by a centralised framework.However, severing those ties, he said, would ""pose a severe handicap"" to UK research.""The idea that any decoupling of China is in the national interest seems to me highly unlikely,"" he said.Related TopicsChinaHuaweiTelecommunicationTop StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published10 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published4 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

But there are several traffic cones on the right lane of the road, causing it to stop.At this point, the remote-assistance helpline is called and a member of staff speaks to Mr Johnson through the car's system - updating him on when roadside assistance will arrive.A few minutes later, the taxi moves into an open left lane and then repositions itself so it blocks the road entirely.Construction workers arrive to remove the cones, giving the taxi a clear path, but it stays still for a few minutes.Then, when roadside assistance arrives, the taxi starts driving away. A few moments later, the taxi stops a second time - after being confronted with traffic cones again - and then drives off once more as roadside assistance approaches.Eventually, the car is disabled and a human driver takes over the wheel.media captionThese taxis will not have a human behind the wheel Ina statement Waymo said the vehicle had ""detected an unusual situation"" and sought remote guidance from a specialist working for the company.But the specialist team had provided incorrect guidance, the taxi had been unable to complete the trip and roadside assistance had had to step in.“While the situation was not ideal, the Waymo Driver operated the vehicle safely until roadside assistance arrived,"" the company said.“Throughout, Waymo’s team was in touch with the rider, who provided thoughtful and helpful feedback that allows us to continue learning and improving the Waymo Driver.“Our team has already assessed the event and improved our operational process.”'Occasional mistake'Mr Johnson regularly posts videos about his experience in Waymo taxis and defended the technology.""I'm just being honest with what I see,"" he tweeted.""How can I prove the technology is great, if I hide it when the occasional mistake happens?Speaking as the video maker here, this Waymo performance with cones is the exception to the rule.

But the inclusion in Nature means the paper has now been peer-reviewed by other academics. It has been made available as a preview of papers due for publication.Millions of notificationsThe paper covers the time between the app's launch on 24 September last year until the end of 2020. It was ""used regularly"" by 16.5 million people - about 28% of the UK population, the research says. It works by using a smartphone's sensors to measure how close a user is - and for how long - to other app users. If one of those people tests positive for coronavirus, the app can issue an alert telling those who have been in close contact to self-isolate.It sent about 1.7 million ""exposure notifications"" after 560,000 app users tested positive, the research paper said.They estimate that every 1% increase in app users resulted in cases being reduced by between 0.8% and 2.3%.The difference between those two numbers comes down to two different ways the team used to calculate the impact of the app.Why are MPs criticising NHS Test and Trace?NHS Covid-19 app update blocked for breaking rulesContact tracing app to share QR code check-insThe first used a ""modelling"" approach, making assumptions about transmission and how strictly people stuck to quarantine. The second involved looking at data from local authorities on actual cases. Both were compared to how widely the app was used to estimate its impact.Researchers said the number of cases prevented was 284,000 on the modelling approach, and 594,000 using the statistical one. That translated to 4,200 or 8,700 prevented deaths respectively.""On balance, an effect size between the two estimates seems most likely,"" the researchers said. App 'awareness'But they also noted that there could have been another ""genuine, albeit indirect, effect of the app"".They suggested that ""users [could] maintain a greater distance from others than they otherwise would have done, aware that the app monitors distance and could later advise quarantine.""This would mean that our modelling estimate... is too low, and our [higher] statistical estimate is more accurate,"" they suggested.The research paper also revealed some info about how the app was used.media captionWATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work?It was more widely used in areas that were ""more rural, with less poverty"", and the effect on reducing transmission was larger after the significant changes to the way the app's tech worked in October - something the researchers referred to as ""a significant upgrade"".Before the upgrade, the app had faced a series of struggles. Initially, the UK opted to build its own system rather than the widely-used built-in Apple-Google system offered by the tech giants, before reversing course.When it was launched, it emerged some older phones could not run the app, and the contact tracing could at times be inaccurate. It also faced resistance over misplaced concerns the tracking functionality could somehow be accessed by police.More recently, the entire Test and Trace operation - including manual contact tracing, which has similar rates of infection to those alerted by the app - has been heavily criticised by politicians as having ""no clear impact"" despite a multi-billion budget.This latest research suggests that the app, taken by itself, has had some effect.But the researchers also warned about placing too much faith in the system.""Digital tracing is not a substitute for manual tracing: both are valuable,"" the paper says.""It is not a substitute for social distancing or face masks: control of the epidemic requires all available interventions to work together.""Related TopicsCoronavirus pandemicAppsMore on this storyNHS Covid-19 app to issue more self-isolate alertsPublished29 October 2020How does Test and Trace work?Published2 days agoNHS Covid-19 app update blocked for breaking rulesPublished12 AprilContact tracing app to share QR code check-insPublished6 AprilNHS Covid app has told 1.7 million to self-isolatePublished9 FebruaryWhat is contact tracing and how does it work?Published24 April 2020Top StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published17 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published5 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

""Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal.""The company was attacked by ransomware group Darkside, on Friday, and forced to take operations offline.The 5,000-mile (8,000km) pipeline supplies 45% of the petrol and jet-fuel needs of the east coast of the US.The ensuing panic-buying led the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to tweet: ""Do not fill plastic bags with gasoline.""Cyber-espionage campaignPresident Biden's order was not written specifically in response to the latest attack but it is understood to have been delayed to take it into account.It was initially prompted by the so-called SolarWinds cyber-espionage campaign discovered in December 2020.That was one of the worst in history, with cyber-spies able to access emails and networks across multiple US government departments.It has been blamed by the US and UK authorities on the Russian government.'Zero trust'The wide-ranging order requires all government departments to:adopt multi-factor identification log-in systems within 180 days  accelerate moves to ""cloud"" and ""zero trust"" frameworks designate which ""unclassified data"" is too sensitive to be kept in normal networks storageconduct more thorough reviews of critical-software suppliersIt also puts an emphasis on private cyber-security companies improving their own defences and being more transparent about when they themselves are attacked.And it states cyber-security vendors must report intrusions within 72 hours of discovery.Chris Krebs, former leader of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), tweeted the order ""lays out an ambitious and achievable work plan to dramatically improve the security of US government networks by using the power of the purse"". ""Kudos to the team for pulling this together,"" he added.If cyber-security wasn't a hot topic for President Biden before, then the past four months has been a baptism of fire(walls) for him.Since December, the US has been on the receiving end of three of the worst cyber-attacks in history.Each one has been entirely different too, testing the administration in different ways.Solarwinds was a long-running and targeting espionage campaign aimed at the heart of government reportedly by a foreign state - Russia.The Microsoft Exchange Server attack, in March, was a mass smash-and-grab against tens of thousands of private company's email systems, thought to have been by state-affiliated criminal gangs based in China.And right now a criminal gang, thought to be based in Russia, is holding the country's largest pipeline to ransom, causing chaos at petrol pumps.Mr Biden can't solve all these potential attacks with the sweep of his pen - but this executive order is clearly aimed at creating a trickle-down effect.If he can improve government defences, it will set a standard for cyber security across the entire country.Related TopicsJoe BidenCyber-securityMore on this storyHow did cyber-attackers shut off a US pipeline?Published10 MayUS petrol supplies tighten after pipeline hackPublished12 MayTop StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published17 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published5 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

Kelly Rocklein claims she was fired two weeks after fainting and hitting her head while with him at a nail salon.Mr Charles has responded by posting a video on Twitter, where he has 7.8 million followers.He had been taking a break from social media after admitting sending sexually explicit messages to two boys aged 16.Following this, YouTube temporarily demonetised his account, which has 25 million followers.'Racial slur'Ms Rocklein, who worked for Mr Charles for six months in 2018, is suing for wrongful dismissal, lost wages and emotional distress.She says she was working 12-18 hour days, producing videos, managing his social media and coming up with content ideas.She also alleges he would ask her to do additional personal tasks, such as clean his house and pick up his dirty laundry, and used a racial slur on multiple occasions.She was paid $72,000 (£51,400) per year for the role but says ""it felt like doing two jobs, seven days a week"".'Taking advantage'Mr Charles says her claims are ""ridiculous absurd, untrue, defamatory... the craziest claims you could imagine"".

""They said no.""Mr Charles says he has refused to pay a settlement.""My only option is to pursue this to the fullest extent of the law,"" he says.'More expensive'Mr Pairavi confirmed Mr Charles's complaint that the overall cost of the resulting legal action now ran into hundreds of thousands of dollars but said it was ""not unusual"" for this type of claim.""The longer it takes, the more expensive it becomes,"" he added.The case can now be made public, following a failed attempt at arbitration.

NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week - BBC News,"NHS app ready to become vaccine passport next week - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechNHS app ready to become vaccine passport next weekBy Cristina CriddleTechnology reporterPublished11 MaycommentsCommentsSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsCoronavirus pandemicimage copyrightGetty ImagesEngland’s NHS app will be available to use as a vaccine passport from Monday, the government has said - but only for those who have had both doses of the jab.A paper version will also be available - by calling 119 but not through a GP.Both will be available from Monday, 17 May, when the ban on foreign travel is eased.The NHS app is separate to the NHS Covid-19 app, which is used for contact tracing.People can already use the NHS app to:request repeat prescriptionsarrange appointments to see their doctor view medical recordsIt can also show vaccine statuses, including for coronavirus, but currently this feature must be enabled by a GP before it appears on the app.The new update will contain a separate feature to display coronavirus vaccine records, so the government said there should be no need to contact GPs.The app will not show coronavirus test results, but the NHS plans to incorporate this in the future, the government website said.It advised people to register to use the app at least two weeks before travelling.A paper letter can be requested only at least five days after a second vaccine dose and can take five days to arrive.Pre-departure test“There are not many countries that currently accept proof of vaccination,” the government advice warns. “So for the time being, most people will still need to follow other rules when travelling abroad – like getting a negative pre-departure test.”The government has announced 12 countries people in England can travel to, without having to quarantine when they return.But not all of these destinations allow UK tourists.For example, travel to mainland Portugal and the Azores is currently for essential purposes only.The list will be reviewed every three weeks. Countries can be added or removed at short notice.It's finally becoming clearer exactly how the government plans to use the NHS app as a vaccine passport.It had been assumed it depended on getting GPs to share a patient's data with the app. I'd been on the phone to my GP surgery because neither of my two jabs was showing up in the app. But this morning a Department of Health spokeswoman told me that NHS X - the health service digital division - has designed an update to the app which doesn't depend on GP records. The update won't go live until May 17th  and will provide a new tab displaying your vaccine record, the idea being that this is all you need to show rather than any other sensitive data being visible. What's not clear however is whether this solution will be acceptable to foreign airlines or border police. But there is one message the government is keen to get out - don't do what I did and ring your GP.Holiday destinationTravellers also need to take coronavirus tests before returning to England and after arrival. Some countries may also require tests to be taken upon entry to the holiday destination.European officials have announced plans for an EU-wide ""Green Digital Certificate"". This would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the region.Officials hope the certificate will be in place before the summer.Several companies have been working on apps to make travel easier, including trade body the International Air Transport Association, who are piloting 'Travel Pass'. It said it has been in discussions with government to ensure the pass can read data from the NHS App.""We're keen to go further and faster now that the Secretary of State has confirmed that travellers will have access to their covid vaccination status by 17 May,"" a spokesperson added. ""Globally there are now 20+ countries that are either easing testing or quarantine requirements for vaccinated passengers so the UK needs to move quickly if it does not want to fall behind globally in supporting its citizens' ability to freely travel.""LOCKDOWN RULES: What are they and when will they end?OXFORD JAB: What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine?GLOBAL SPREAD: How many worldwide cases are there?QUARANTINE: Will I need to self-isolate in a hotel?

"Apple's UK users deserve app price compensation, claim says - BBC News","Apple's UK users deserve app price compensation, claim says - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechApple's UK users deserve app price compensation, claim saysPublished11 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesMillions of Apple's UK customers should be compensated for breaches of competition law, a legal action claims. The case, filed with the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), alleges Apple's 30% commission on app sales is an abuse of dominance and unlawful. Organisers are aiming to include nearly 20 million UK users in the collective action, if it is approved. Those behind the claim say they intend to seek damages of up to £1.5bn. Apple said the legal action was ""meritless"".Collective actionWhile the UK does not have the same kind of class-action legal structure as the US, so-called ""optout"" claims have been allowed in the CAT since 2015, meaning all affected people could be covered unless they decide to exclude themselves.And anyone in the UK who has bought paid apps, paid subscriptions, or other in-app purchases on an iPhone or iPad since October 2015 is included in the claim. However, such a collective action needs to be approved by the tribunal before proceeding. While the 30% Apple cut on sales is already facing challenges from other companies, the group behind this claim say it is customers who have ultimately paid the fee. It alleges: Apple deliberately shuts out potential competition it requires ordinary users to use Apple's own payment-processing system doing so generates ""unlawfully excessive levels of profit"" the charges are ""an unlawful raid on Apple's customers' purses""  King's College London digital-economy lecturer Dr Rachael Kent, who is taking the case to the tribunal and representing all those affected, said Apple ""charges entry and usage fees that are completely unjustified"".""This is the behaviour of a monopolist and is unacceptable,"" she said. Apple's estimates of its costs for running the App Store were ""just $100m"" (£71m) - but it had made $15bn (£10.6bn) last year. ""Apple achieves this by slapping unjustified charges on its users,"" Dr Kent said.""It would not be able to impose these exorbitant charges if competitor platforms and payment systems were allowed to compete.""Apple charged over 'anti-competitive' app policiesApple faces Epic Games in courtThe rest of the team behind the case includes law firm Hausfeld and Co and Vannin Capital. Vannin would be paid - a proportion of the total compensation, from ""damages that are left unclaimed"" - only if the case succeeded, the group said, ""putting their money at risk for a lengthy legal battle with one of the wealthiest corporations in the world"". ""Claimants will not lose out,"" the group added.In a statement, Apple said: ""We believe this lawsuit is meritless and welcome the opportunity to discuss with the court our unwavering commitment to consumers and the many benefits the App Store has delivered to the UK's innovation economy.""It highlighted that the 30% cut is ""very much in the mainstream of those charged by all other digital marketplaces"", and said 84% of apps on its App Store were free - so developers paid nothing. It also argued that the ""vast majority"" of developers paid a commission of 15%, in an apparent reference to its recent decision to cut rates on the first $1m.Legal battleApple's competitor Google also charges a 30% fee, along with several other digital platforms. But the group said it was ""not in a position to comment on Google at the moment"". Apple has faced a backlash from several developers in the past year, along with scrutiny from an EU competition investigation and the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee in the US. It is embroiled in a major US-based legal battle with Epic Games, which says Apple's policies prevent it competing on price. And earlier this year, the competition tribunal rejected Epic's attempt to bring that case into the UK, while allowing a similar one against Google to proceed.

Colonial hack: How did cyber-attackers shut off pipeline? - BBC News,"Colonial hack: How did cyber-attackers shut off pipeline? - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsTechColonial hack: How did cyber-attackers shut off pipeline?By Joe TidyCyber reporter Published10 MaySharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty ImagesInvestigators at the largest fuel pipeline in the US are working to recover from a devastating cyber-attack that cut the flow of oil.The hack on Colonial Pipeline is being seen as one of the most significant attacks on critical national infrastructure in history.The pipeline transports nearly half of the east coast's fuel supplies and prices at pumps are expected to rise if the outage is long lasting.How can a pipeline be hacked?For many people, the image of the oil industry is one of pipes, pumps and greasy black liquid.In truth, the type of modern operation Colonial Pipeline runs is extremely digital.US pipeline hackers 'didn't mean to create problems'The ransomware surge ruining livesPressure sensors, thermostats, valves and pumps are used to monitor and control the flow of diesel, petrol and jet fuel across hundreds of miles of piping.Colonial even has a high-tech ""smart pig"" (pipeline inspection gauge) robot that scurries through its pipes checking for anomalies. image copyrightColonial Pipelineimage captionThe Colonial Pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a dayAll this operational technology is connected to a central system.And as cyber-experts such as Jon Niccolls, from CheckPoint, explain, where there is connectivity, there is risk of cyber-attack:""All the devices used to run a modern pipeline are controlled by computers, rather than being controlled physically by people,"" he says. ""If they are connected to an organisation's internal network and it gets hit with a cyber-attack, then the pipeline itself is vulnerable to malicious attacks.""How did the hackers break in?Direct attacks on operational technology are rare because these systems are usually better protected, experts say.So it's more likely the hackers gained access to Colonial's computer system through the administrative side of the business.""Some of the biggest attacks we've seen all started with an email,"" Mr Niccolls says. ""An employee may have been tricked into downloading some malware, for example. ""We've also seen recent examples of hackers getting in using weaknesses or compromise of a third-party software.""Hackers will use any chance they get to gain a foothold in a network."" Hackers could potentially have been inside Colonial's IT network for weeks or even months before launching their ransomware attack.In the past, criminals have cause mayhem after finding their way into the software programs responsible for operational technology.In February, a hacker gained access to the water system of Florida city and tried to pump in a ""dangerous"" amount of a chemical. A worker saw it happening on his screen and stopped the attack in its tracks.Similarly, in winter 2015-16, hackers were able to flick digital switches in Ukrainian power substations, causing cuts affecting hundreds of thousands of people.media captionBusinesses are being held to ransom by callous cyber-criminalsHow can this be stopped?The simplest way to protect operational technology is to keep it offline, with no link to the internet at all. But this is becoming harder for businesses, as they increasingly rely on connected devices to improve efficiency.""Traditionally, organisations did something known as 'air gapping',"" cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont says.image copyrightColonial Pipeline Companyimage captionColonial Pipeline says it was hacked on Friday, 7 May""They would make sure that critical systems were run on separate networks not linked to outward facing IT. ""However, the nature of the changing world now means more things are reliant on connectivity.""Who are the hackers?The FBI has confirmed DarkSide, a relatively new but prolific ransomware gang thought to be based in Russia, was responsible.It is unusual for criminal groups to attack ""critical national infrastructure"" - but experts such as Andy Norton, from cyber-defender Armis, says it is a growing concern.""What we're seeing now is the ransomware gangs are maturing,"" he says.""Where there is critical public service on the line, there is more chance of them getting the ransom paid."" image captionAn example of a DarkSide ransomware notice that appears on victims' computer screensInterestingly, the group posted something of an apology for the hack on its darknet website. Although not directly referencing Colonial, it referred to ""today's news"", saying: ""Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society. ""From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.""Like many ransomware groups, DarkSide runs an affiliate programme allowing ""partners"" to use its malware to attack targets, in exchange for a percentage of the ransom profits.DarkSide have previously said it would start donating some of the extorted money to charities. How can critical services be protected?Experts have long been concerned about critical national infrastructure being hacked.Last month, the Ransomware Task Force global coalition of experts called it a ""national security risk"".The group says governments need to take urgent action to prevent ransoms being paid in secret. media captionExperts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebodyIt also wants pressure put on countries such as Russia, Iran and North Korea, which are regularly accused of harbouring ransomware groups.But Mr Norton says organisations need to take responsibility as well.""It's up to organisations to implement the type of cyber-security that is appropriate and proportionate and it's recognised that there are more teeth required by regulators to enforce this,"" he says.Related TopicsUS national securityCyber-crimeCyber-securityCyber-attacksOil & Gas industryNational securityMore on this storyUS pipeline hackers 'didn't mean to create problems'Published10 MayThe ransomware surge ruining livesPublished30 AprilTop StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published21 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published5 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

""Clients may stop hiring me because they recognise that voice.""'Ordinary people'Robert Sciglimpaglia, the lawyer representing Ms Standing, told BBC News: “The technology exists where anyone's voice can be replicated through artificial intelligence.“This is not an issue just about celebrities or voice actors, who of course will be hugely impacted because their livelihood is literally being taken away from them. “This is also about ordinary people.""Neither TikTok nor parent company Bytedance had responded to the legal filing, issued in New York last week, he added.Local accentsStanding’s voice is used on the North American version of the app. But in other regions, local accents - a British male voice in the UK, for example - are used. A TikTok representative told The Telegraph, which first reported the story, it did not comment on continuing litigation. The company told BBC News it had nothing further to add.The Chinese Institute of Acoustics did not respond to a request for comment.'Moral rights'""Actors' performances, including vocal performances, are protected by copyright,"" Jowanna Conboye, intellectual property and technology partner at Spencer West, said.

Mr Lewis, founder of the website Money Saving Expert, said the whole issue sickened him.Experts at the cyber-agency, which is part of intelligence agency GCHQ, say it's a growing problem.What are fake endorsement scams?Criminals create fake news articles claiming that celebrities are backing new investment schemes. The articles are spread through mass email campaigns, SMS texts, or adverts on social media.They come with a link to websites which encourage victims to invest in the unscrupulous programmes.Although the theme of these attacks is often cryptocurrency, the template can be used to promote any type of fake investment opportunity. ""Makes me feel nauseous""Mr Lewis said: 'It's the worst flattery I've ever had. These thieves and con artists leach off the reputation for trust I've built up by trying to help and protect consumers, in order to try and steal money off vulnerable people.'The concept makes me feel nauseous. We must step up our fight to stop these scams which destroy millions of people's finances and mental health.'The news comes from the NCSC's annual Active Cyber Defence report which outlines the actions the agency took to prevent fraud, scams and cyber-attacks.Why can't Google get a grip on rip-off ads?'I lost £400,000 to fake Elon Musk giveaway scam'Martin Lewis gets Facebook pledge over fake adsThe NCSC says it began taking action against the websites in April 2020, and by the end of the calendar year it had taken down 286,322 separate campaigns across 731,080 URLs. The cyber-agency says the relatively new scams are a global issue.UK victims see curated content with recognisable British figures, but if you were to view the same article from France, the content served would probably appear as an article in a fake French newspaper featuring a celebrity from the country. ""Really convincing""Ian Levy, the NCSC's technical director, said Mr Lewis and Mr Branson made up ""a decent chunk"" of all the celebrity endorsement scams they discovered. ""They're really convincing and it's no surprise that people fall for them. Criminals use both newspaper brands and celebrities combined to make these articles look really good,"" he said. ""Martin Lewis and Sir Richard Branson are used because they are famous and because they are related to money. It must be horrible for them.""Mr Lewis is urging the government to reverse its decision not to include scams in the future Online Safety Bill, which is expected to be in the Queen's Speech this week. image copyrightNCSCimage captionThe NCSC says it took down more than 139,000 scam online shopsIn 2019 Mr Lewis agreed to drop legal action against Facebook for allowing his name and photo to be used in fake adverts on the platform.In return, Facebook agreed to donate £3m to set up an anti-scam programme.Elsewhere in the NCSC's report, it says it carried out a 15-fold increase in campaign takedowns in total.The agency it took action against nearly 1.5 million web addresses from fake shops to phishing sites pretending to be government services.Related TopicsCyber-crimeSocial mediaMore on this storyWhy can't Google get a grip on rip-off ads?Published3 MayTop StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published21 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published5 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

Danger products: 'I heard a loud crackle and bang'Amazon and eBay 'listing unsafe toys for sale'Dangerous products remain for sale on WishThis latest move, eBay said, was designed to speed up the removal of ""illegal or unsafe items"" without waiting for approval from the company.Only selected, trusted authorities will have access to the new tools. But those that do will have ""the ability to take down any listings from the marketplace themselves"", the company said.More than 50 authorities around the world are already involved in the early stages of the project, it added.Harmful productsEBay said it already had ""extensive"" reporting systems for customers to use and took ""pro-active"" steps to remove banned items.But ""eliminating the need for a second level of approval streamlines the process, making product removal more efficient and reducing the risk of harmful products being purchased,"" it said.Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First, said: ""We welcome any move that speeds up the process of removing dangerous goods online"".""Our investigations have continuously found dangerous, unbranded electrical goods with obvious visual defects for sale to UK consumers. These products often lack some of the most basic safety features.""But she added that more work needs to be done to stop such products going on sale in the first place.""Online marketplaces must be legally recognised as a retailer in order to sufficiently tackle the issue of dangerous goods sold via their sites and we urge the government to include these sites in their forthcoming Online Safety Bill,"" she said. One group involved in eBay's new system is Westminster Council. Councillor Heather Acton said the past year had seen a huge increase in shopping online - and scams and fraud were a concern.The new tools mean ""our trading standards teams have been able to expedite our processes and ensure that our local communities can continue to be safe"", she said.Another body with access is Ofcom, which among other roles regulates the radio waves used for broadcast and wireless signals. Certain types of wireless radio kit are tightly regulated - so that they cannot interfere with protected signals - and it plans to use the new tools to remove such items from sale.Murray Lambell, eBay's UK manager, said the pandemic had led online shopping to become ""an even greater part of everyone's lives"".""Market places should be taking their responsibility for consumer safety seriously, but collaboration with authorities is vital,"" he said.""We hope that other players in the industry will follow suit,"" he added.Related TopicsOnline shoppingTrading StandardseBayCompaniesMore on this storyAmazon and eBay 'listing unsafe toys for sale'Published20 November 2019Danger products: 'I heard a loud crackle and bang'Published23 October 2020Shoppers told to avoid cheap electronics on AmazonPublished17 November 2020Dangerous products remain for sale on WishPublished4 FebruaryTop StoriesChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryThe Chinese leader was speaking at an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party.Published21 minutes agoHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Published5 hours agoBill Cosby freed after conviction overturnedPublished7 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest' Video'When I saw that video my heart was ripped from my chest'The pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayAre more migrants crossing US-Mexico border than ever?The teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

Speaking for 23 minutes, the star said she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having children.Abuse claims investigation""I just want my life back,"" she said, via phone, as she asked the court to end her conservatorship.However, the judge cannot make a ruling based on her statement until she files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement.The documents filed on Wednesday refer only to the November request, in which Spears asked for the private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust to be appointed as her ""sole conservator"".Although Judge Brenda Penny refused to remove Jamie Spears from his position, she did agree to the Bessemer Trust's role as co-conservator of the star's multi-million dollar estate.In a separate development, Jamie Spears' lawyers have asked the court to investigate the star's claims of abuse.The LA court system has also ended a scheme allowing members of the press to listen to court proceedings remotely, after audio of Spears testimony was recorded and leaked online.What has Britney said?image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionBritney Spears had hits with songs like Baby One More Time, Oops!...

She claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant.media captionBritney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorshipDozens of fans gathered outside court, holding signs that read ""Free Britney now!"" and ""Get out of Britney's life!""The star later apologised to them for ""pretending like I've been OK"", but pride and embarrassment had prevented her from admitting the truth.What has her dad said?image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionJamie Spears and Britney, pictured in 2006Mr Spears' lawyers have denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter's private life.While the 68-year-old has overseen her estate for 13 years, he has not actually been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health.He was replaced on a temporary basis by Jodi Montgomery, the singer's care-giver.On Tuesday, Mr Spears' lawyers requested an inquiry into his daughter's testimony.""Either the allegations will be shown to be true, in which case corrective action must be taken, or they will be shown to be false, in which case the conservatorship can continue its course,"" they wrote in a court filing. ""It is not acceptable for Conservators or the Court to do nothing in response to Ms Spears' testimony.""Mr Spears's lawyers said he had no intention of returning as his daughter's personal conservator, but said he was ""concerned "" about her well-being.They added: ""Mr Spears is unable to hear and address his daughter's concerns directly because he has been cut off from communicating with her"".Who is supporting Britney?image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionIggy Azalea and Justin Timberlake have both spoken out against the conservatorshipDozens of stars have voiced concern for the singer, including her former boyfriend Justin Timberlake.""Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was… what's happening to her is just not right,"" he wrote in a statement.

But writer Max Porter, who penned the initial script pre-pandemic, hopes he will appeal to most viewers' better natures.'An element of real strangeness'""That's really the point of the piece - we want it to be collaborative with the viewer, so that they are confronting their own religious, spiritual, political, physical relationships to the world around them,"" Porter explains.""It was a kind of post-apocalyptic piece, or certainly a kind of depressive confessional, turning into something ecstatic, we hope.""But to film it during a pandemic gave it an element of real strangeness that we couldn't possibly have planned.""image copyrightManchester International Festivalimage captionCillian Murphy has starred in Peaky Blinders and 28 Days LaterPorter is perhaps best known for his debut novel Grief is the Thing with Feathers and the Booker Prize-listed Lanny. For his latest project, he worked alongside film and music video director Aoife McArdle (U2, Bryan Ferry, Anna Calvi) to bring the ever-evolving monologue from the page to the screen.McArdle found some ""extraordinary locations around London"", Porter notes. ""Places that looked like they could be from a kind of broken sci-fi version of London or an abandoned film set version of London in this character's mind.""It's almost like he's sort of testing out real places against the places in his mind.""'Embraced the madness'The film-maker found the process of charting one man's internal and external torment to be pretty ""poignant"" right now, she says, and it put her ""back in tune"" with why she loves doing what what she does.She also found that Murphy didn't even mind too much when she made him lie down in the mud several times during one particularly dark and rainy night shoot.""We kind of went with the adrenaline of it,"" she says. ""I feel like you do feel that everything he's saying is unfiltered and happening in real time, and even though the words are so poetic it still feels very natural and that's down to his {Murphy's] skills, and the way he embraced the madness of the way we shot it!""It all adds, I think, to the sensory experience you get.""image copyrightManchester International Festivalimage captionThe film is like a cross between Dante's Inferno, a Samuel Beckett play and The Verve's Bittersweet Symphony music videoMurphy, who shot to fame nearly 20 years ago in another post-apocalyptic movie, 28 Days Later, said he felt ""very fortunate to have had the opportunity to make this work during the turmoil and sadness of 2020"".Well-written and stylishly shot, All of This Unreal Time also comes wrapped in an intensely industrial-sounding and naturalistic score composed by electronica DJ and producer Jon Hopkins, alongside Aaron and Bryce Dessner from the US alternative rock band The National.Taylor Swift fans may know Aaron Dessner as the man who helped to make her recent Grammy-winning album, Folklore, while BBC Radio 6 Music listeners and festival ravers will be aware of Hopkins' expertise in creating ambient minimal techno beats.'Industrial and dark'""There's a real prevalence of industrial noise and darkness of the city and it gradually moves into more of a natural space towards the end,"" Hopkins explains. ""When you hear some gentle sounds in nature, they're particularly nourishing for having been through that all that darkness before.""I'm personally most proud of the ending scene,"" he adds. ""I won't give away what it is, but that was one of the places where music had a little bit of space to breathe and there was an opportunity for some more pensive melody and some actual chords! Because a lot of it is very industrial and dark."" image captionJon Hopkins performing for BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac show in 2018Until Sunday, visitors to this year's slightly re-imagined biennial arts festival can experience the film inside a ""next level"" immersive light and sound installation at the Manchester Central venue. Complete with ""birds surrounding you, and bottles on the street clinking"", McArdle beams.For those unable to make it to Manchester, the film has been made available to view on the festival website.Whichever way people choose to absorb it, both the director and writer want the real work to begin for audiences as soon as the end credits roll.""You'll get something that is totally baffling and asking you to answer questions,"" Porter concludes.""What is it? Is it a film? Is it a confession? Is it a poem? Is it a rant? [Or] is it Cillian having a breakdown?""All of This Unreal Time is on at Manchester Central from 1-4 July, and on demand until 18 July as part of Manchester International Festival.Related TopicsFilmManchesterMore on this storyTaylor Swift's Folklore sees the singer go indiePublished24 July 2020Manchester arts festival unveils amended line-upPublished28 AprilPeaky Blinders film to follow final TV seriesPublished19 JanuaryTop StoriesSearch and rescue paused at collapsed Miami blockWork at the Miami building is paused over structural concerns with President Biden visiting shortly.Published47 minutes agoChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryPublished1 hour ago'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Published15 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwaveMisleading stat claims more vaccinated people dieThe pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayThe teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

I think that it's a really cool film to, if you can and you feel safe to, go back to the cinema to.""Harbour said: ""It feels like we're starting to get back to normal again.

Lady Boss documentary recasts Jackie Collins as feminist icon - BBC News,"Lady Boss documentary recasts Jackie Collins as feminist icon - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsEntertainment & ArtsLady Boss documentary recasts Jackie Collins as feminist iconBy Emma JonesBBC Talking Movies reporterPublished1 day agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionAll 32 of Jackie Collins' novels appeared in the New York Times bestseller listHugely successful author Jackie Collins may have been branded the ""Queen of Sleaze"" by some literary critics due to her explicit novels, but a new documentary is exploring her career in a new light - as a feminist icon.Collins, the sister of actress Dame Joan, sold about half a billion books and published 32 novels during her lifetime, but they were  banned in some countries due to their content.Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story, by filmmaker Laura Fairrie, looks back at the life of the London-born writer, whose works include bestsellers such as 1983's Hollywood Wives. Collins died of cancer in 2015, but Fairrie had access to Jackie's diaries and was able to interview the author's three daughters as well as Dame Joan. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionLaura Fairrie's film was part of the recent Tribeca Film Festival in New York""I was looking for another film to do, and I wanted to make it about a fabulous woman,"" Fairrie explains. When she heard talk of a project about Jackie Collins, she simply said: ""She was my sex education.""Fairrie recalled Collins' books being passed around at school.""We read them in maths lessons hidden under the desks, so I just had this connection to her from my teenage years, that immediately just gave me a really good insight into who she was.""She added: ""I was interested in turning the tables and looking at the other side of the public story. The persona that she created.""image copyrightModern Filmsimage captionJackie and Joan Collins teamed up in 1977 for The Stud, the film starring Joan written by JackieCollins was born in 1937, and her father was a showbusiness agent. She started writing diaries at a young age, but her first novel, The World is Full of Married Men, was published in 1968, after the author had left an unhappy first marriage. The book, about extramarital affairs, was banned in Australia and South Africa. Collins later moved to Los Angeles and published a series of books about her favourite heroine, Lucky Santangelo, including 1981's Chances and 1990's Lady Boss.  Her novel Hollywood Wives, which has sold 15 million copies, was an explicit look at Tinseltown and represented the height of her career in the 1980s.image copyrightModern Filmsimage captionJackie Collins, pictured in 1995, lived in luxury in Beverley Hills""When I spoke to Jackie's friends in Hollywood, they said that when the book was published, that there was a queue around the block of all the maids in uniforms outside the bookstores,"" Fairrie recalls. ""They'd been sent to get the books by the real 'Hollywood wives' who were going to go through it and see if they were in it. Partly they wanted to be in it, but they were afraid of it too.""Jackie Collins: Shining a light on Hollywood's glitteratiThe documentary, which recently premiered at New York's Tribeca Film Festival, examines how Collins would turn some of her private unhappiness into a fantasy world with feisty heroines who knew how to get what they wanted. This earned her millions of readers. ""Hollywood, Los Angeles, was the dream, it represented the fantasy, and Jackie was always chasing the fantasy,"" the director explains. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionJackie and Joan in 1955 on location for the film Land of the Pharaohs""And I think that that is always kind of such a key part of understanding who she was and the books that she wrote. For her, reality often wasn't the most comfortable place. ""So she wrote books that had these fantasy endings. She'd take a real situation and change the ending to the one that she wanted. She consistently turned the tables on men, she'd consistently write about women, characters such as Lucky Santangelo, who were almost superhuman.""It was this feminist fairytale world, and she chased that world herself.""Part of Jackie Collins's feminism, Fairrie adds, stemmed from her own experiences in Hollywood when she accompanied her sister Joan as a teenager. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionJackie Collins, pictured aged 17, was chasing success from a young ageIn later life, the author admitted she'd had a brief affair with actor Marlon Brando when she was 15 years old and he was aged about 30.""Jackie had seen her sister Joan become this incredible success at an early age, and so she was chasing that for herself,"" Fairrie says. ""She was a wild teenager who wanted to get out there and have these amazing adventures. Joan explains in the film that she just let her loose in Hollywood and let her go to all the parties with her and hung out with everyone from Brigitte Bardot to Marilyn Monroe and Marlon Brando. And she wrote about all of this in her diaries.""Fairrie said what she found most interesting about Jackie Collins was that despite her adventures, she also had experiences as a young woman that ""perhaps weren't entirely comfortable"" on the casting couch, ""in an era where women were expected to look and behave in a certain way"".The filmmaker adds: ""She definitely had experiences that weren't always great. ""And she put those stories into her books. Disguises the names, disguises the places. But the tough times are in the books, as well as the outrageous Hollywood stories.""media captionAuthor Kathy Lette: ""She was a literary role model for women""The director thinks Collins ""would have loved"" the present era of the #MeToo movement.""Her daughters said to me, 'if only she was here to see this.'"" Fairrie says. ""I think she'd have loved this time, because it almost feels like her brand of feminism, and her books, really have a place in the world today. ""Her feminism was about sexual desire, freedom to live life in the way that you wanted, freedom to choose the careers you want, the men you want, the sex you want and not to be judged for it, and that's really radical. And in some ways, it still is quite radical.""During the 90s, Collins was ""looked down upon and criticised a lot"", says Fairrie, who adds: ""Today I think people can really celebrate her for the author that she was, and for the fact that she lived her life true to herself."" Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story  is on release in cinemas nationwide in the UK and Ireland from 2 July.

""Because I made this track with some sort of sporting event -  a boxing match or a football match - in [my] head.""Just this kind of survivor feel to it, something very epic, like when something is about to happen.""He continues: ""[I wanted] to create some kind of feeling of invincibility, like when you're walking on the street and listening to a track and you feel really pumped up.""And I guess it definitely works for the Euros.""Figure captionWarning: Third party content may contain advertsThe compatriot of Paul Pogba, Kylian Mbappé, Eric Cantona et al admits he doesn't ""know much"" about le foot, but says he now has ""no excuse"" not to watch it.""It's funny because my best friend was never into football since I knew him,"" he adds, ""and now [since the track] he's gone completely crazy about it.""'Set the tone'The BBC's football creative director Mark Woodward, who helped to select the song, noted how a major sports tournament ""deserves a music track to set the tone, and Force Majeure definitely does this"".""This summer, Euro 2020 across the BBC will be consumed by millions and Gaspard's first single as a solo artist works perfectly alongside our TV output,"" he said.The TF1 channel in Augé's native France returned the compliment, selecting Higher Power by England's very own Coldplay as its official theme song.""Maybe it means Brexit is over,"" jokes Augé.""To be fair, to me it just means that the English people have better taste in music.""While the Beeb went for a bit of French electro, soaked in synths, bass and beats, to soundtrack the summer of football, the other UK Euros broadcaster, ITV, did plump for something homegrown - Michael Kiwinuka's You Ain't the Problem.image copyrightJasper S Spanningimage captionGaspard Augé is a French electro DJ and producer, who rose to fame as one half of JusticeEarlier this year, Augé and his Justice bandmate Xavier de Rosnay, had more on their minds than football.The pair made the headlines for sending a cease-and-desist letter to pop star Justin Bieber regarding what they claim is the Canadian's use of their name and signature ""cross"" logo for his latest album.The rock 'n' roll DJs lost an emergency request to a French court to prevent Bieber's album and merchandise from being sold. But their lawyers have told us that was a provisional decision and proceedings are ongoing.""People when they reach that level of fame they feel like they can get away with anything,"" Augé opines. ""And I guess because they can.""The BBC has asked Bieber's representatives for a comment.'Perfection doesn't exist'Over the past 15 years, Justice have followed in the footsteps of their now sadly departed countrymen Daft Punk in taking radio-friendly dancefloor-filling remixes, like We Are Your Friends, from the nightclubs of Paris to the world.Augé decided it was ""the right time"" to put out his debut solo album this summer in order to break up ""the four-year pattern"" of writing, recording and touring that the pair have been in since their 2007 debut.Escapades, which features his Euros theme, took three or four months to complete which he points out is quick when compared with the machinations of his Grammy-winning festival headlining act.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionAugé and his Justice bandmate Xavier de Rosnay (right) performing in Berlin in 2017""I guess it was maybe a bit more continuous and probably less perfectionist, but this is what I like about these kind of projects,"" he says.""It is good to hone everything, but it's also good to let the music live its own life at some point, because obviously perfection doesn't exist - it's very subjective.""The largely instrumental LP is described as ""a modern electronic album heavily inspired by classic film scores of the 20th century"" and the short audio-visual offerings so far have certainly had a big screen feel. Its star has been shown testing out freshly hand-crafted drum cymbals in the video for Force Majeure, and attempting to avoid being shot by a sniper with a bass guitar gun in the one for Captain. While for Hey!, another mystery man has been pictured playing a violin while riding on a galloping horse.image copyrightJasper S Spanningimage captionForce Majeure from his debut solo album has soundtracked the summer of football on the BBCAugé is still trying to ""think of a formula"" for how to perform it live in the UK at some point with an orchestra and a choir, but that's proving pretty tricky right now due to the joint effects of Covid and Brexit.The music is designed ""to give people simple emotions that anybody can enjoy"", Augé says.""Depending on their own life story or musical background they can put whatever they want on to the music. It's a very open record.""England fans will be hoping it proves to be a lucky one, too.Gaspard Augé's debut solo album Escapades is out now.Related TopicsFranceMusicMore on this storyDaft Punk announce split after 28 yearsPublished22 FebruaryTop StoriesSearch and rescue paused at collapsed Miami blockFears of a further collapse force work to pause at the Miami building.Published53 minutes agoChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryPublished1 hour ago'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Published15 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwaveMisleading stat claims more vaccinated people dieThe pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayThe teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

""And that was really bothering my conscience.""So I felt my integrity being gnawed at and the only way I could square those two things is by this decision I made.""Marshall announced his departure from Mumford and Sons last week, posting a lengthy statement in which he expressed anguish at being portrayed as a supporter of the far-right.""I failed to foresee that my commenting on a book critical of the far-left could be interpreted as approval of the equally abhorrent far-right,"" he wrote.

""The public can see through this Orwellian language and will never stomach the BBC intimidating the elderly.""Responsibility for TV licences for the over-75s was passed from the government to the BBC as part of the broadcaster's last royal charter.The BBC said continuing to fund free licences for all older viewers would have forced it into ""unprecedented closures"" of services. But in 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the BBC should ""cough up"" and cover the cost.In January, the government decided not to move ahead with plans to decriminalise non-payment of the TV licence fee but said it would ""remain under active consideration"".The following month, the BBC said no enforcement action had been taken against anyone who previously held a free over-75s TV licence.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

""Rich in historical resonances, a painting of supreme poise and elegance, The Blue Boy is without doubt a masterpiece of British art.""image copyrightThe National Galleryimage captionThe Blue Boy at the National Gallery in 1922 attracted 90,000 visitors over three weeksThe painting, which depicts a young man in a blue satin suit set against a moody country landscape, is thought to be of Jonathan Buttall, the son of a wealthy merchant.It was bought and taken to the US by the railway pioneer Henry Edwards Huntington. Since then, it has been on display at the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California.Before The Blue Boy left British soil, the then-National director Charles Holmes wrote ""Au revoir"" on the back of the painting in the hope it would one day return.'Iconic status'The painting's popularity and cultural influence have seen it quoted by contemporary artists and depicted in Hollywood films including Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, in which one of Jamie Foxx's outfits was said to have been inspired by that worn by Gainsborough's young subject.The artwork was also seen in films including 1989's Batman, Joker and The Naked Gun.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionThe Blue Boy on display at the Huntington MuseumThe Huntington's president Karen R Lawrence said: ""This masterpiece has made an indelible mark on both art history and popular culture, capturing the imaginations of a wide range of audiences. ""Given The Blue Boy's iconic status at The Huntington, this is an unprecedented loan, one which we considered very carefully. We hope that this partnership with the National Gallery will spark new conversations, appreciation and research on both sides of the Atlantic.""'Showing off'In 2018, the Huntington began to restore the painting, with much of the work carried out in public in what was dubbed the Project Blue Boy exhibition. Despite the painting's fame, it is acknowledged as being largely inspired by the work of Anthony Van Dyck.""We have to remember that this painting wasn't commissioned, but rather was produced by Gainsborough for the express purpose of showing off his prowess at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1770, where it would be seen next to the work of his rivals,"" Project Blue Boy co-curator Melinda McCurdy told ArtFix Daily in September.""Gainsborough intended it to grab attention, and conservation work has revealed the incredible technical skill he brought to this showpiece.""The Blue Boy will be on show at the National Gallery, London, from 25 January to 15 May 2022.Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

""You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy."" He added: ""That's what I did.""The veteran singer-songwriter also included hashtags referencing Bob Dylan's 1965 classic Subterranean Homesick Blues, which inspired Pump It Up; and Chuck Berry's 1956 single Too Much Monkey Business, which influenced the Dylan song.You can compare the Costello and Rodrigo tracks below. The guitar riff first appears 14 seconds into Brutal, and at 15 seconds in Pump It Up:Figure captionWarning: Third party content may contain advertsFigure captionWarning: Third party content may contain advertsCostello's relaxed reaction comes despite a surge in music copyright cases in recent years.Perhaps the most infamous case was over the hit song Blurred Lines - in which the family of Marvin Gaye accused Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams of plagiarising Gaye's song Got to Give It Up.The jury's controversial verdict found that Thicke and Williams had copied the ""vibe"" of Gaye's 1977 hit - rather than lifting a melody or chord sequence, which is usual bar for plagiarism.The unstoppable rise of Olivia RodrigoOlivia Rodrigo makes UK chart historyMarvin Gaye's family keeps $5m payoutSince then, stars like Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry and Childish Gambino have all been sued for millions over similarities between their songs and earlier hits.Others have taken the precaution of crediting writers who might have a claim, even a tangential one, to protect themselves against legal action.Notably, Taylor Swift gave Right Said Fred a share of her song Look What You Made Me Do because her chorus melody followed a similar rhythmic pattern to their 1990s novelty hit I'm Too Sexy.Rodrigo and her co-writer Daniel Nigro have not done the same for Brutal - but it seems Costello is honoured, rather than annoyed, by the hat-tip.Costello previously gave permission for Pump It Up's riff to be sampled in Rogue Trader's 2005 dance hit Voodoo Child.image copyrightDCG/Geffen Recordsimage captionCourtney Love has complained about similarities between Rodrigo and Hole artworkMeanwhile, Rodrigo has faced separate accusations of plagiarism from Courtney Love.Love highlighted similarities between the artwork for her band Hole's 1994 album Live Through This and the images used to promote Rodrigo's Sour Prom, a livestream concert taking place on Tuesday.Both images show a prom queen holding flowers while mascara streams down their faces.""My [album] cover was my original idea,"" Love wrote on Facebook.

""To young people just starting a career, it's crucifying.""The government says musicians can make short visits to 17 of the 27 EU states.They include frequent touring destinations such as France, Germany and the Netherlands where, the government says, concerts can be staged ""without needing visas or work permits"".However, entertainment union Bectu said there are still ""varying degrees of bureaucracy"" in those 17 countries; and that the government's statement doesn't ""quite match up to the expectation that you can do what you could before"".UK stars urge action over post-Brexit touringWill UK bands start touring in Liechtenstein?Sir Elton John fears musicians face 'catastrophe'Sir Elton said his anger was the result of unsuccessful attempts to lobby politicians.""We've been talking to Lord Strasburger about it, and we've been talking to Lord Frost [the UK's Brexit minister], but we didn't really get anywhere with him,"" he said.Lord Strasburger is a Liberal Democrat peer who has been vocal in his criticism of the government's  handling of post-Brexit touring issues.Asked why there had been resistance from the government, the star said: ""They are philistines. The Government are philistines. We've got used to governments - especially the British government - just telling us lies every day, and I don't feel OK with that.""Look what they did with the NHS. After all that those people did during Covid, they give them a 1% [pay] increase. I find that extraordinary. I just can't live with that. It makes me so angry.""'Tossed away'The star said he was ""livid"" at the way musicians' livelihoods were being affected, and pointed out that other arms of the entertainment industry were suffering, too.""They made no provision for the entertainment business, and not just for musicians, actors and film directors, but for the crews, the dancers, the people who earn a living by going to Europe.""People like me can afford to go to Europe because we can get people to fill in the forms and get visas done, but what makes me crazy is that the entertainment business brings in £111 billion a year to this country and we were just tossed away.""The star's comments came days after a collective of artists - including Radiohead, Biffy Clyro, Skunk Anansie, The Chemical Brothers and Ghostpoet - wrote to the government calling for urgent action to prevent ""the collapse of the industry"".""It's essential that bands, artists, musicians and DJs can travel Europe at every level of their career,"" said Primal Scream's bassist, Simone Butler, who also signed the letter.""To make it financially and logistically unrealistic to do shows and festivals will be halting the livelihoods and careers of generations of musicians,"" she added.image captionNoel Gallagher says touring Europe with his band, the High Flying Birds, will have to be scaled down due to BrexitNoel Gallagher has also expressed anger at the situation, saying his touring plans will have to be cut back.""You can't just get on a train and go to Paris and do a gig [any more],"" the former Oasis singer-songwriter told Radio 4's Front Row. ""You've got to apply to do a gig and you've got to declare what equipment you're bringing - and that's things that never cost us any money two or three years ago, which is going to cost a fortune.""He continued: ""So I just think, ultimately, like most things, the fans are going to lose out because instead of bands going to Europe for four weeks now and doing three gigs in Germany, there'll be one. And there will be one in France, and one in Spain, and one in Belgium, and then it'll be a whistle-stop, scaled-down show.""The government has issued the same response to every criticism of the EU touring situation, saying: ""We want musicians and other creative professionals to be able to tour easily abroad.""Short-term, temporary visits for paid performances by UK musicians are possible in at least 17 EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, without needing visas or work permits.""However, we recognise the difficulties still being faced by the sector. That is why we are working closely with individual member states to encourage them to adopt a more flexible approach, in line with the UK's own rules which allow creative professionals to tour easily here.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Love Island: ITV2 dating show returns after 18-month break - BBC News,"Love Island: ITV2 dating show returns after 18-month break - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsEntertainment & ArtsLove Island: ITV2 dating show returns after 18-month breakBy Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporterPublished3 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightITVimage captionThe islanders have reportedly been in quarantine for two weeks in the run-up to the series launchLove Island returns to screens on Monday after an 18-month break enforced by the coronavirus pandemic.It will be the first new series of the ITV2 dating show since Paige Turley and Finley Tapp were crowned the winners of the first winter series last year.Eleven new islanders are set to enter the villa in Majorca, with Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling returning to hosting and narrating duties.ITV has also announced an updated range of welfare measures for contestants.Here's everything you need to know ahead of the launch.When does it start?image captionLaura Whitmore will host again after taking over from the late Caroline FlackThe seventh series of Love Island kicks off on ITV2 at 21:00 BST on Monday.""Love Island was sorely missed last summer, and I wouldn't be surprised if ratings are higher than ever for this series,"" says Bonnie McLaren, senior entertainment writer at Grazia.""It continues to be so popular for its ability to create nationwide conversation, whether that's over fiery arguments, hilarious moments - like Curtis saying he 'also wants to be one who wakes up in the morning and makes everyone a coffee' while breaking up with Amy - or more serious topics, like gaslighting.""The show has previously attracted praise for sparking debates about acceptable behaviour in relationships and shining a light on issues such as manipulation and girl code. ""And the contestants are always characters,"" McLaren adds. ""The list of islanders who have remained famous after their time on the show is incredibly long. The people in the villa - while you might not like all of them - are all incredibly entertaining to watch, and they're handpicked for being excellent TV.""Which brings us to this year's crop of contestants hoping to couple up.Who's who?image copyrightITVimage captionLeft-right: New islanders Faye Winter, Aaron Francis and Liberty PooleWe already know who the first 11 islanders will be, but expect several more to join the series over the next few weeks.PE teacher Hugo Hammond will become the show's first disabled contestant, although some viewers have described his casting as ""a step rather than a leap"" in the show's efforts to be more inclusive.He'll be joined by water engineer Jake Cornish, model-turned-influencer Shannon Singh, fashion blogger Kaz Kamwi and labourer Brad McClelland.Former civil servant Sharon Gaffka has possibly the most interesting back story. She worked on Brexit policy, did a stint in the Department of Health during the initial coronavirus response, and worked for six months in the Department for Transport.Then there's lettings manager Faye Winter and former waitress Liberty Poole, whose previous job in Nando's should give Stirling enough material for plenty of ""extra hot"" jokes.Financial services marketing executive Chloe Burrows, luxury events host Aaron Francis and semi-professional footballer Toby Aromolaran complete the starting line-up.Of course, these are just names and job titles - we won't really get a sense of what the new islanders are like until they're actually in the villa. Ultimately, their personalities, screen presence and chemistry with the other islanders will determine their success.How is the series going to work?image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionIain Stirling will return to narrate the texts, tantrums and triumphs of the villaYou'll have noticed that 11 is an odd number, and therefore one of the new islanders will be single from the beginning while the other 10 couple up. The show often starts this way, and it's a good way of creating some drama early on.Our new batch of Islanders have reportedly been in quarantine in Spain for the last two weeks ahead of the series launch, and there will be strict Covid protocols on site.It's thought there will also only be a skeleton crew based in Spain - with many of the show's editing and gallery staff working from London.""There's lots of changes, and lots of protocols in place, but actually on screen no, there shouldn't be any changes,"" ITV commissioning editor Amanda Stavri recently told the Radio Times.Whitmore will return to hosting duties, dropping into the villa every so often for recouplings and evictions, and will present the weekly Aftersun specials. Her real-life partner Stirling, meanwhile, will provide the voiceovers.What can the contestants expect from taking part?image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionMolly-Mae Hague, pictured with partner Tommy Fury, is one of Love Island's biggest success storiesIn short, cash - provided they can successfully capitalise on their new-found fame. Arguably the biggest break-out star of Love Island in recent years is Molly-Mae Hague, who is thought to be the highest-earning former contestant, and certainly has the biggest social media following.It's worth reading this excellent Vice article about how she did it. ""Molly-Mae is everywhere. In a way that no other Love Island alumna has quite managed,"" wrote Lauren O'Neill, commenting that Hague had ""set a gold standard for influencers"".Not every contestant can expect that type of career. Many vanish without a trace, while others find the fame slipping after the initial flurry around them has subsided.Former contestant Montana Brown told Cosmopolitan: ""The first year after Love Island, I behaved like a bit of a brat - people give you everything for free, and do everything for you.""But you can't forget that you're quite disposable in this industry. Future contestants need to know what they're getting into, and also understand that fame and money don't last forever.""Will the contestants be taken care of? image copyrightITVimage captionOne of this year's contestants, Sharon Gaffka, is a former civil servantITV has announced a newly improved set of after-care measures following concerns about the mental health of previous contestants.The suicides of two former islanders in recent years prompted a debate about whether the show was doing enough to prepare them for the pressure that comes with the subsequent fame.Contestants on the new series will be taught how to handle the ""potential negativity"" of social media as part of the show's duty of care protocols.The training forms part of a revised set of welfare measures, which will also see participants get ""comprehensive"" psychological support.What's the big deal about Love Island anyway?image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionPaige Turley and Finley Tapp won the winter series of Love Island last yearWhile fans eagerly anticipate the show's return, there will also be plenty of people who spend the coming weeks shouting about the fact that they don't watch or care about Love Island.Sure, it's trashy, disposable, junk-food TV, but the fact that so many subsequent dating shows haven't quite managed to drum up the same excitement as Love Island during its absence is perhaps proof of its hard-to-define magic.Shows like The Cabins, Too Hot To Handle and Love Is Blind have kept us going in the last year or so, but none have quite compared with a summer of Stirling helping us navigate those texts, tantrums and triumphs under the Spanish sun.""Personally, I couldn't be more excited for the series to return,"" says McLaren. ""And I think a lot of the people are the same. ""After 18 months off screen, and how - quite frankly - dull Winter Love Island was, I think the series is going to be more popular than ever, even though people now have the option to socialise instead of being stuck at home.""Related TopicsLove IslandReality TVMajorcaTelevisionITVMore on this storyWhat I wish I'd known before I went on Love IslandPublished6 days agoLove Island announces summer cast after year offPublished21 JuneITV announces new Love Island welfare measuresPublished16 JuneTop StoriesSafety fears force search pause at Miami blockFears of a further collapse force work to pause at the Miami building.Published1 hour agoChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryPublished1 hour ago'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Published15 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwaveMisleading stat claims more vaccinated people dieThe pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayThe teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

Anne Robinson on Countdown and cancel culture - BBC News,"Anne Robinson on Countdown and cancel culture - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsEntertainment & ArtsAnne Robinson on Countdown and cancel cultureBy Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporterPublished3 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightChannel 4image captionAnne Robinson on the set of Channel 4's Countdown with Rachel Riley (left) and Susie DentAnne Robinson might be the first female presenter of Countdown, but it's probably best you don't draw that to her attention.""When Channel 4 said to me 'you'll be the first woman', I groaned, because I was rather hoping we'd got past the stage of being completely astonished that a woman can do the same job as a man,"" she says ahead of her debut. ""Maybe we haven't. You might as well say I'm the first presenter of Countdown who's got O-negative blood.""This observation perfectly sets the tone for half an hour in Robinson's company. She speaks frankly and lives up to her formidable reputation. The 76-year-old has previously fronted consumer affairs programme Watchdog and quiz show Weakest Link, proving she could terrify business chief executives and members of the public in equal measure. She has often enjoyed playing up to her fearsome persona - even when the cameras aren't rolling. But, Robinson says, she's planning to go slightly easier on Countdown's contestants.""One of the rules I had on Weakest Link was I never ever met the contestants before [filming],"" she recalls. ""Even on the celebrity shows, I'd come on to the podium, the lights would be ready to go, and people would say, 'Hi Anne', and I'd just keep a straight face and ignore them. That helped to build the atmosphere.""But on Countdown, I do say 'hello, how are you', simply to allow them to see that the slightly pantomime character on Weakest Link isn't all of me. And I do think they're quite nervous, and I don't really want that, I want to be able to play with the contestants and get the best possible out of them.""image captionRobinson says she played up to her pantomime villain character on quiz show The Weakest LinkCountdown first aired in 1982, inspired by the French TV series Des Chiffres et Des Lettres (Numbers and Letters). Since then, it has remained a constant presence in Channel 4's schedule, its format reassuringly unchanged amid the fast-evolving television landscape. The show sees contestants make words out of randomly chosen letters and solve maths puzzles and anagrams. Her predecessors as hosts were Nick Hewer, Jeff Stelling, Des O'Connor, Des Lynam, and, most famously, Richard Whiteley, the man who started it all back on Channel 4's opening night.Robinson says there are ""several reasons"" for the show's enduring appeal. ""First of all, it's cerebral. I like the way it has dark and light in it,"" she says. ""There's Susie [Dent] doing origins of words, there's Rachel [Riley]'s amazing maths, and the contestants are very, very skilled. And I think it's never tried to bow to any of that shiny floor excitement. It's gone on being authentic.""(I say 'mmm' in response to this, to indicate my agreement, and immediately regret it. ""'Mmm?' What does 'mmm' mean? Was that answer not interesting?"" she asks. It's almost as scary as facing her in the studio.)Robinson's appointment to the show has, inevitably, attracted controversy. As soon as it was announced, social media users dug up old clips from the Weakest Link, where she would pick on contestants for their appearance, sexuality or the fact they were on benefits. Her habit of humiliating members of the public, some argued, made her an unsuitable host for Countdown.""It is a baffling decision,"" wrote Rupert Hawksley in the Independent. ""This gentle, mid-afternoon game show, best enjoyed with a cup of tea and a slice of Battenberg, deserves better than Robinson's vicious tongue and pursed lips."" Channel 4 must have known this was coming, and indeed stuck by her as she was set upon by the Twitterati. image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionRobinson says she hasn't requested any advice from previous host Nick HewerRobinson says she is blissfully unaware of most criticism. ""What I do, because I'm not technically able to understand Facebook or Instagram or Twitter, I don't have any of those, so I can go on thinking everyone thinks I'm wonderful. It saves a lot of grief and it saves a lot of time.""That's as may be, but how does she respond to the suggestion that she couldn't get away with her Weakest Link put-downs nowadays?""Well, I think it's true,"" she replies. ""One of the several reasons we wouldn't do Weakest Link again is that we're into [the] woke era now. And there would be endless confusion about it. So you're quite right."" But while Countdown might bring out a softer side, her former steely demeanour won't be totally absent. ""[The contestants] have not been cast as we did on Weakest Link, to expect and enjoy being teased,"" she says. ""On the other hand, there would be no point in hiring me and not hiring Huw Edwards.""(Shortly after our interview takes place, The BBC announces it is bringing back Weakest Link for a weekly celebrity series, with Romesh Ranganathan as the presenter.)Unsurprisingly, Robinson has limited time for cancel culture; where an opinion someone expresses can damage their career. ""Well, it's exhausting isn't it?"" she says. ""Because it's cutting out genuine criticism. I hate it that television, newspapers and charities are all pandering to it. Instead of supporting the people who support their newspaper or their charity.""image copyrightChannel 4image captionCountdown first aired in the UK nearly four decades agoRobinson will have to put up with a gruelling diary as Countdown's new host. ""It's quite a schedule,"" she comments, ""it's five shows a day, which in effect means you do a week's programme each day.""She hasn't requested any advice from Hewer, despite it being offered. ""Through the producer, he very kindly said he was available. But, and this isn't meant to be rude, I sort of thought it was it was information I could do nothing with. You know, it would be like Gary Lineker telling me how to do Match of the Day. We're just two completely different people.""We rattle through a few more subjects. She welcomes the significant increase in female presenters on high profile TV shows, from Strictly Come Dancing to Question Time, but notes it has not happened at a particularly fast pace.""And there's always been a showbiz belief that you need pretty girls,"" she adds. ""We don't judge guys... we don't look at the screen and say 'God, he's ugly' all the time. But you might be in danger of doing that with women, because you're so conditioned to any woman you see on television looking top dollar.""She adds: ""I did a Radio 2 Saturday morning show for 10 or 11 years, and at that time in the early 90s, you never played two female singers back to back. You have to remember how long it's taken to even get where we are now.""image captionRobinson doesn't know how long she'll host Countdown, but points out Mary Berry is still on TV at 86And what about the idea that women need to have surgery if they want to remain on TV after a certain age? Robinson has always been open about hers. But these days, a presenter like Lorraine Kelly is over the age of 60 and has publicly and proudly stated she's never gone under the knife.""Lorraine is absolutely entitled to not do anything,"" Robinson replies. ""And you're quite entitled to have surgery if you want to. I mean, why should anyone, particularly other women, object to you doing whatever you want to do? Most of them have got pierced ears after all.""Finally, we ask about how long she might do Countdown for, bearing in mind she hosted roughly 2,000 episodes of The Weakest Link, including the US version. ""Look, somebody said that to me yesterday, 'would I still be there when I was 86',"" she responds. ""And we looked it up, and Mary Berry is 86 and she's still on television. So, I don't know.""

"Jack Savoretti takes us on a guided tour of his new musical genre, Europiana - BBC News","Jack Savoretti takes us on a guided tour of his new musical genre, Europiana - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsEntertainment & ArtsJack Savoretti takes us on a guided tour of his new musical genre, EuropianaBy Mark SavageBBC music reporterPublished4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsEurovision Song Contestimage copyrightChris Floydimage captionThe star's latest album is based on memories of childhood holidays in Portofino""I'm a Mediterranean boy at heart,"" says singer-songwriter Jack Savoretti. ""It's where I feel happiest.""But, stuck inside over the last year, he didn't have many chances to indulge that passion. So he started to daydream.""Looking out the window wasn't enough anymore. So I had to create this kind of escapism - a holiday, a getaway, in my head.""As his mind drifted back to childhood memories of sun-kissed beaches and swimming off the Italian coast, he started to imagine a soundtrack - full of the sounds of Demis Roussos, Julio Iglesias, Gipsy Kings, Jacques Brel and Italian disco.They're all artists he thinks the UK, with its strange aversion to foreign language music, has missed out on.""Jacques Brel's Song Of Old Lovers - La Chanson Des Vieux Amants - to me it's the greatest love song ever. It's untouchable,"" he says. ""And I've spent numerous nights after too many bottles of wine, translating it word for word for my friends.""I got so sick and tired of doing that I decided to write my own versions of these French, Spanish, German, and Italian songs and make them in English.""The result is Europiana, the star's seventh album and the follow-up to his first UK number one, Singing To Strangers. He claims, rather boldly, that Europiana is an entirely new genre, drawing on his Swiss-Italian-British-American upbringing to create something unique. ""It's the music of my childhood summers, remade for today,"" he explains.The album was created with his band in his Oxfordshire home last summer with the windows wide open. ""The sun and fun seeped into the songs,"" he recalls.image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionMany of the album's songs were inspired by spending lockdown with his wife, Jemma Powell, and their childrenThe sonic palette will be familiar to anyone who's ever taken a package holiday or watched Eurovision - albeit with a touch more class. But, whatever you do, don't expect Savoretti to throw his name in the ring for next year's Song Contest.""No, because Eurovision doesn't represent what's happening in Europe musically,"" he says. ""It represents what's happening in Europe on television. ""It really highlights how every country does showbusiness - but not music.""With that out of the way, we settle down to go through his new album, track-by-track, exploring the influences and experiences that make up Europiana.1) I Remember UsThe album starts with the sound of Savoretti's wife and daughter singing a simple, naïve melody - setting up the album's themes of reconnecting with family. ""I would never have written this song, if we hadn't been forced to be at home together. For me, last year was really about rediscovering my wife and myself,  as a couple and as lovers, as friends, as partners, as parents."" (It must have gone well - the couple had a new baby daughter two months ago).""Lockdown was suddenly this moment of 'Oh, I remember us','"" he says. ""And that was the seed for the rest of the album - because I already knew the sound and the setting. I just didn't know the characters in the film.""2) Secret Lifeimage copyrightChris Floydimage captionThe singer says European music often has an innocence and naïveté that's missing from English-language songs""The song is essentially about coming to terms with yourself, warts and all. Everybody has this little secret life. That doesn't mean it's riddled with sin - although it usually is!With echoes of the Pet Shop Boys' It's A Sin, the song has a spoken word interlude where Savoretti and his wife, actress and painter Jemma Powell, whisper to each other: ""I won't tell if you don't tell.""""That really threw my band,"" the singer laughs. ""They were like 'Is that Jemma? Aren't you talking about your secret life?'. And I said 'why wouldn't she be a part of my secret life?'.""Sometimes your lover might be your secret life. In my case, we have a shared experience we like to keep private. It doesn't necessarily mean you're hiding stuff.""3) Who's Hurting Who (ft Nile Rodgers)Figure captionWarning: Third party content may contain adverts""Having Nile on board was so important, because he is the godfather of Europiana - and he didn't even know it.""With Chic, Nile took disco-funk music, which was a quintessentially underground, African-American style in black clubs and gay club and made it mainstream in America.""Then it was embraced by European artists - who didn't face the same struggles he faced. For them, it was glamorous, it was like a luxury item. It wasn't an underground thing, it was aspirational, and it created what I call Europiana. And without that, we wouldn't have had Daft Punk and Phoenix.""4) When You're LonelyA song about missing someone when they're gone, and reminiscing about falling in love - with vocals from 80s pop legend John Oates,  a squiggly synth solo and a splash of accordion for that continental touch.""I don't know if I should say this, but in our relationship, distance has always made the heart grow fonder,"" says Savoretti. ""We're so used to being apart, that we love coming back together. It's such a part of our relationship that not having that this year was interesting.""Homeschooling was particularly tough. I did try to put my two cents in at the beginning - and then very quickly both my children and my wife realised that I was distracting more than anything. ""I was told to leave the room, basically.""You may also be interested in:The unstoppable rise of Olivia RodrigoSir Tom Jones: 'I might be old but my voice is still young'Dave Grohl: 'I dreamt I was shot in the back'5) More Than Everimage copyrightJack Savorettiimage captionThe singer was born in England, raised in Switzerland and Italy and partly educated in the US""I literally say in the song, 'Looking back on all my memories with so much joy / Summers spent in Italy when I was a boy'. It's like the instruction manual of the album.""I really love that concept of the narrator turning to the audience and explaining why they're listening.""A stripped-back ballad, the song consists solely of Savoretti's raspy voice and a sweeping grand piano. Does he feel any pressure when he has to sing with such sparse accompaniment?""Not at all, I get off on that pressure, especially live. I enjoy the intimacy of that moment. It is terrifying, but when it works it's magic.""6) Too Much HistoryFigure captionWarning: Third party content may contain adverts""I did think of this album as a vinyl record, and this is the side two, the second half of the show. You're at a party in the south of France, on some yacht by some sea. You're a little bit sunburned, the salt's still on your skin, and you're having a first cocktail in the evening, and it's going to be a great night.""The lyrics are about spending time with the people who know you best, who have ""seen the good and bad""  and ""remind me from where I came"".""Leaving London was really good for that,"" says the singer. ""Because in London I knew a lot of people but I didn't have a lot of friends. I think in my 20s I was like 'Would you be my friend? Would you be my friend?'. You're a bit desperate - you're just trying to feel like you belong. ""Whereas, out here in the countryside, I realised I'm at an age where I've got a pretty damn good group already. I've got a pretty solid band of brothers.""7) Dancing In the Living Room""Very early during lockdown, I realised that Covid was scaring my wife and scaring my kids. It was very macabre sitting every evening, watching how many people died. So I created this thing called Fabulous Fridays, which was a party every Friday night.""We came up with a theme every week - so we had Italian night, we had Spanish night, we had French night, we had Mexican night. It was usually pretty cultural, but sometimes it was, like, The Greatest Showman night, and we went crazy. We literally had proper dance-offs in the living room.""That's when I started rediscovering Europiana. because I started playing a lot of Gipsy kings, a lot of Boney M, a lot of Diana Ross, a lot of Chic. And my daughter called me out and said, 'Papa, why don't you make music like this?'.""8) Each And Every Moment""The day before writing this, I learned to play Dreams by Fleetwood Mac - and that whole song only has two chords. So the next day I woke up and I was like, 'I'm gonna write a song with two chords, too.'  ""I did it kind of as a joke - but I sent it to my manager and he was like 'this is possibly the best song you've ever written'.""9) The Way You Say GoodbyeFigure captionWarning: Third party content may contain adverts""This is the song I've always wanted to write, I can't hide it. ""I've always wanted to have a song where I could sit at a piano with a glass of wine and a cigarette and sing conversationally - almost like it's being made up as you go. ""It's my Jacques Brel, Charles Aznavour moment. It's the olive in the martini glass. When you leave the club and you walk through the hotel lobby, this is what's playing.""10) Calling Me Back To You""This was written with my old friend Gizmo Varillas. He's from the north of Spain, which is on the Atlantic, and I'm from the Mediterranean - and it's funny because all we do is talk about the sea. ""And so we wrote this song about a lighthouse, about the thing that draws us back. As someone who has travelled a lot, even though I was born in England, I sometimes feel like a foreigner. ""But the one place I do feel at home is by the sea. That gives me a sense of belonging, and so we wrote a song about that.""11) War Of Wordsimage copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionThe star plans to go on tour in September""This is a bit of a lullaby - a song from a father to his children. What's that great line Thumper says in Bambi? If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all. ""We are in a time right now where everybody is pretty vicious.

William Blake: Biography offers glimpse into artist and poet's visionary mind - BBC News,"William Blake: Biography offers glimpse into artist and poet's visionary mind - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMenuMoreSearchHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeCoronavirusVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechScienceStoriesEntertainment & ArtsMoreHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesReality CheckNewsbeatLong ReadsEntertainment & ArtsWilliam Blake: Biography offers glimpse into artist and poet's visionary mindBy Paul GlynnEntertainment & arts reporterPublished5 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingimage copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionFew took William Blake seriously as an artist and poet in his lifetimeOne day in 1801, when William Blake was living on the Sussex coast, he went on a long country walk when he got into an argument with a thistle.The artist, poet and musician, who experienced beatific visions throughout his 69 years on Earth, wasn't wandering lonely as a cloud, like some of his Romantic peers.On this occasion, the prickly plant he encountered also took the form of a hectoring old man. For all Blake could see, the two were inseparable.The London shopkeeper's son (who didn't go to school) would also regularly see God, angels and demons, and often spoke with the spirit of his dead brother Robert. His wife Catherine once commented: ""I see very little of my husband, he's always in paradise.""These divine and mind-bending experiences informed Blake's world view and inspired his deeply philosophical illustrated texts like Jerusalem and Milton.As a result, though, he was deemed mad by much of 18th and 19th Century England, and died penniless and largely unheralded.Nowadays, he is widely considered one of UK's most influential and respected artists and poets. And in a new biography, William Blake vs the World, author John Higgs argues we are now far better placed to understand what was going on inside his head.'Mythological system'""Blakeans have been touchy about the subject historically,"" Higgs tells the BBC. ""There was the one exhibition he gave in his lifetime and it sold no paintings, and it got one review which referred to him as 'an unfortunate lunatic'. And so this accusation of madness followed him around in his day.""Van Gogh scholars are quite happy to admit he had mental health issues, and that adds to their understanding of him. [But] Blake scholars have been traditionally keen to insist that he was not mad, that there is reason and logic and worth in this system that he created - this mythological system.""image copyrightGetty Images/Culture Clubimage captionA portrait of Urizen, the embodiment of restricted thought, reason and law, from William Blake's The Book of UrizenHe adds: ""I think now we're in a position where we can say, yeah absolutely he was [sane]. But there was a period where he had poor mental health. In his letters there were references to melancholy, as a disease, and depression, and also later incidents that show signs of paranoia.""Those mental health issues arose around the year 1800. ""It was just a period in his life and you can see at the end of his life how he had come through it, with the help of his wife, and was just in a very blissful state,"" Higgs continues.Blake's high regard for contrary states, as evidenced in his Songs of Innocence and Experience and The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, suggests he knew that what goes up must come down. Slip inside the eye of your mindThe key to achieving timeless bliss, he believed, was to re-balance the imagination (or The Four Zoas) so the left-brain - the part that deals with logic, reason and language - was less dominant, unlocking the potential of the right side, which deals with creativity, emotions and physical pleasure.The polymath underlined the importance of viewing things through one's mind's eye, rather than merely through the organs on either side of your nose. In his book, Higgs cites the work of neuroscientist Dr Adam Zeman, who has studied the imagination for decades. He first described in 2015 the condition of aphantasia, where some people were found to be unable to visualise mental images. In other words, they had no mind's eye.At the opposite end of the spectrum, those with extremely vivid imaginations were said to have hyperphantasia.Dr Zeman, who released his latest research findings last month - with the help of his colleagues at the University of Exeter and around 70 volunteers willing to have their brain activity scanned - agrees with Higgs that rather than meaning he was unhinged, Blake's visions strongly suggest hyperphantasia.media caption""When I think about my fiancee, there's no image"" Niel Kenmuir on living with aphantasia""[Blake] seems to live in the world of his own imagination to a great degree,"" Dr Zeman says. ""Some people [with hyperphantasia] say that it is hard for them to be sure whether they've imagined something, or it actually happened because their imagining is very vivid.""Neither extremes, which are believed to affect millions of people around the world, are viewed as disorders, he notes. They are more like interesting variations of perspective, each with their own pluses and minuses.Hyperphantasics tend to be more open and have abundant mental imagery, research shows, but can be more vulnerable to emotions that images fuel - like regret, disgust or longing.Aphantasics tend to be more introverted, have thin autobiographical memoires - relying more on facts - and often miss being unable to picture loved ones they have lost. However, many highly imaginative people, including Pixar animations co-founder Ed Catmull, Mozilla Firefox co-creator Blake Ross and leading scientists Oliver Sacks and Craig Venter have all lacked imagery.image copyrightHistoricaGraphicaCollection/Heritage Images/Gettyimage captionUrizen measures out the material world in The Ancient of Days, taken from Europe a Prophecy by William BlakeThere is some evidence to suggest that very vivid imagery can put people at the risk of psychosis, Dr Zeman says, if they lose sense of the boundary between what's real and what's imaginary - which Blake's contemporaries clearly thought he had done.But he thinks Blake, who died almost 200 years ago, may have been an early adopter of the increasingly accepted idea in psychology and cognitive neuroscience today that ""all our experience, in a sense, is imaginative"".""Although we aren't aware of it, a huge amount is happening in our brains all the time to enable us to see, hear or make sense of anything,"" Dr Zeman says. ""An experience itself is a creative act, let alone the echo of experience that you get in the mind's eye.""I think Blake had a sense that all of all our whole mental lives - not just the mind wandering, daydreaming, creativity and the artistic sense, but simply having an experience - is a creative and imaginative act.""Or as Blake himself put it: ""The imagination is not a state: it is the human existence itself.""image copyrightCulture Club / Gettyimage captionAlbion contemplating Jesus crucified in William Blake's engraved poem JerusalemThe limited, rational or logical part of our brains, which Blake characterised as Urizen, is actually only a model of how we understand the world, Higgs explains.""We think it's real, we think it's true,"" he says. ""When it feels under threat, it lashes out and tries to defend itself.""You can see on social media, people have a desperate need to be thought of as right. For Blake, it's all about being able to step outside that and just see the rational brain for what it is, as a sort of quite limited small part of a much larger mental experience.""Albert Einstein once remarked on ""the stubbornly persistent illusion of the passing of time"", which was also depicted by Blake in the form of Los.The artist's conviction that concepts like time, God, heaven and hell were all internal creations, Higgs feels, also salvages theological debates for today's more secular UK society.""If you know someone who has been living through hell, the idea that Blake was in paradise becomes a little bit more plausible,"" he says.The doors of perceptionWilliam Blake is by no means the only historical figure to have reported on such ineffable experiences. And his apparent capacity to access parts of the imagination that were beyond the realm of the average person, and the importance he placed on free love, sex and bashing the establishment, were of great appeal in the swinging late 60s.Jim Morrison's band The Doors even named themselves after a famous line from a Blake poem: ""If the doors of perception were cleansed then everything would appear to man as it is, Infinite.""image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionThe Doors attempted to break on through to the other sideThe likes of Timothy Leary and Aldous Huxley championed the use of psychedelic drugs to help achieve Blake-like states of consciousness.For people with aphantasia, Dr Zeman notes, hallucinogens sometimes help them to generate imagery, but it doesn't seem to outlast the drug effect. Higgs compares the practice, as well as that of transcendental meditation, to ""micro-dosing in Blake's eternity"". It's not impossible that Blake may have dabbled in magic mushrooms, the author concedes, but recreational use was not believed to have been common at the time, and he had been chronicling his visions from childhood until old age.image copyrightHuntington Art Collections image captionWilliam Blake's Albion Rose, circa 1793Blake believed we could all work on our imaginations, just like our abs or biceps, and aspire to joining him in ""eternity"".Dr Zeman's studies suggest that while it may be possible to strengthen the mind's eye, ear or fingertip with magnetic pulses, there is a biological and possibly genetic limit to how far along the imagination spectrum each individual can travel. But we should celebrate that difference, he says, and not medicalise it.He is hopeful that one day we will be able to know it better, and ultimately solve the age-old Cartesian conundrum of how consciousness can be generated from that grey, jelly-like lump of tissue in our heads.To give Blake the final word on the matter: ""What is now proved was once only imagined.""William Blake versus the World, by John Higgs, is out nowRelated TopicsArtPoetryMental healthMore on this storyPsychedelic beauty gets the TK Maxx treatment ★★★☆☆Published14 September 2019Aphantasia: A life without mental imagesPublished26 August 2015Top StoriesSafety fears force search pause at Miami blockFears of a further collapse force work to pause at the Miami building.Published1 hour agoChina won't be bullied, says Xi on 100th anniversaryPublished1 hour ago'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Published15 hours agoFeaturesHow to handle the China Communist Party at 100Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law'People went to sleep, and then they died' Video'People went to sleep, and then they died'Canada weather: A visual guide to the heatwaveMisleading stat claims more vaccinated people dieThe pianist playing for Easter Island's futureThe mastermind behind the rebel advance in TigrayThe teen who created an app to help his sister talk.

Only a handful of shows were able to take place, and most of them were in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites.At the start of 2021, organisers were more optimistic.With the vaccination programme under way and mass testing available, dozens of events put tickets on sale, confident that fans would be allowed to mosh, pogo and stage-dive with the risk of injury, rather than disease, their main concern.But as the year has progressed, the summer season has collapsed in slow motion. Events scheduled for the early summer - most notably Glastonbury - cancelled first. Dozens of others followed in April and May, with many citing the inability to obtain cancellation insurance as a factor. Others moved to safer dates later in the summer, with a noticeable bottleneck over August bank holiday weekend. But the government's decision to delay the easing of lockdown restrictions until 19 July has now forced many festivals to shut their doors for another year. To help you plan ahead, here's a guide to the events that have been delayed, cancelled, postponed or given the green light. This page was last updated on Thursday 1 July 2021.Reopening delay a hammer blow - live event sector'The clock is ticking' for summer festival seasonFestivals could be 'as safe as Sainsbury's'TRNSMT music festival moved from July to SeptemberAll Points East - RESCHEDULEDWhen: 27-29 AugustWhere: Victoria Park, LondonWho: Jamie xx, Kano, Slowthai, Arlo Parks, Bicep, FoalsOrganisers have moved the event from its usual slot in May to August bank holiday weekend, giving it a greater chance of proceeding unimpeded. ""We can't wait to welcome back live music in the UK and be back dancing with you all later this summer,"" say organisers.Beautiful Days - ONWhen: 20-22 AugustWhere: Escot Park, DevonWho: James, Frank Turner, Levellers, Gary Numan, Hawkwind, Imelda MayFounded and managed by the band The Levellers, Beautiful Days started in 2003 and has been awarded the title of best family festival at the UK festival awards.Organisers say they are ""planning to go ahead at full capacity"" after Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed. However, tickets are already sold out. Big Feastival - ON When: 27-29 AugustWhere: Kingham, OxfordshireWho: Chic, Sigala, Rag 'N' Bone Man, Zara LarssonHeld at Blur star Alex James's farm in the Cotswolds, the Big Feastival will celebrate its 10th anniversary with the usual mix of music, food, comedy and kids' entertainment. ""We're all in need of a serious celebration this year so we're pulling out all the stops to ensure this is our best line-up yet,"" said James. ""Roll on August!""Big Weekend - ONLINEWhen: 28-31 MayWhere: Radio 1 and BBC SoundsWho: Ed Sheeran, AJ Tracey, Anne-MarieAbout 50 new performances were filmed for Radio 1's virtual festival, with acts like Ed Sheeran and Royal Blood playing in front of ""iconic landmarks"" across the UK. Other sets were shot in the BBC's Radio Theatre; and Radio 1 played out archive performances and piano sessions across the weekend. You can watch the highlights on iPlayer.Black Deer Festival - OFFWhen: 25-27 JuneWhere: Eridge Park, KentWho: Van Morrison, Robert Plant, Frank TurnerOne of the UK's newer festivals, Black Deer concentrates on Americana and bluegrass, with big name music acts spread over several stages. The 30,000-capacity event was set to be one of the first to take place after lockdown restrictions eased, until those plans were delayed on 14 June.""We can't quite put into words how we're feeling right now,""  said co-founders Gill Tee and Deborah Shilling. ""It's devastating news for all connected with Black Deer but we'll be back in 2022"". They said ticket-holders would be informed of their options ""very soon"".Bloodstock - ONWhen: 11-15 AugustWhere: Catton Park, DerbyshireWho: Judas Priest, Kreator, Devin Townsend, SkindredThe long-running heavy metal festival has added an extra day to its line-up due to the postponement of last year's event.However, the festival had to revamp its line-up, explaining that ""due to the ongoing issues and restrictions surrounding Covid-19, a number of overseas bands are no longer able to be at Catton Park with us this summer"". That included former headliners Mercyful Fate, who have been replaced on the bill by Kreator.Boardmasters - ONWhen: 11-15 AugustWhere: Newquay, CornwallWho: Foals, Gorillaz, Jorja SmithIt's been a rough two years for Boardmasters. They were forced to cancel their 2019 event due to severe storms, before Covid-19 wiped out their plans for 2020. Tickets from 2019 will still be valid for this year's festival, which takes place on a cliff-top location overlooking Watergate Bay and Fistral Beach.Organisers said they were ""delighted"" to be coming back in 2021 and thanked fans for ""sticking with us over these past two years"". ""Your continued support has been truly overwhelming and quite simply, we couldn't do it without you.""Boomtown - OFFWhen: 11-15 AugustWhere: Matterley Estate, HampshireA five-day immersive musical and theatrical event, Boomtown had branded its 2021 comeback ""The Gathering"", as a celebration of the return of social contact. However, organisers pulled the plug on 20 April, blaming the government for its inability to provide a Covid-specific insurance scheme.""This means anyone putting on an event this year will be doing so without the safety net of insurance to cover them should Covid prevent them from going ahead in any capacity,"" they said in a statement. ""For an independent event as large and complex as Boomtown, this is a huge gamble of up to an eight figure sum and the financial risk is simply too high.""The festival says it will return in August 2022.BST Hyde Park - OFFWhen: 9-11 JulyWhere: Hyde Park, LondonWho: Pearl Jam, Duran Duran, Grace Jones, Pixies (pictured)BST was one of the first festivals on the calendar for 2021, with three shows planned for the second weekend in July - but on 30 March, organisers confirmed ""with a heavy heart"" that the shows were being postponed until 2022.""Following our review of the most recent government advice, the latest timeline means that we are unable to deliver with certainty the quality BST Hyde Park is known for,"" they said in a statement.Headliners Pearl Jam and Duran Duran will come back for the rescheduled shows, and all tickets remain valid.Camp Bestival - ONWhen: 29 July-1 AugustWhere: Lulworth Castle, DorsetWho: Fatboy Slim, Kelis, Groove Armada, Becky Hill, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Mr Tumble The family-friendly festival announced its return immediately after the government revealed its four-step plan for emerging from lockdown in February. ""There is literally nothing [my wife] Josie and I like more in life than standing in a field surrounded by family and friends, dressed in daft outfits dancing to amazing bands and DJs and Mr Tumble,"" organiser Rob Da Bank told the BBC. ""That's exactly what we plan to be doing at Camp Bestival.""The festival has yet to respond to the extension of lockdown restrictions, and is assumed to be going ahead.Creamfields  - ONWhen: 26-29 AugustWhere: Daresbury, CheshireWho: Deadmau5, Carl Cox, Eric Prydz, Tiesto, Bicep, Martin Garrix, Chase & StatusThe UK's biggest dance music festival sold out in record time when tickets went on sale in February. Organisers are promising fans ""the party of the summer"" after a year locked indoors.Deer Shed Festival - OFFWhen: 20 July-1 AugustWhere: Baldersby Park, North YorkshireWho: James, Stereolab, Baxter Dury, Dream WifeAfter announcing their line-up and putting tickets on sale, the family-friendly Yorkshire festival took the difficult decision to postpone for a second year in April.In a statement, organisers said a lack of cancellation insurance had left them vulnerable. Tickets will roll over to next year; and a smaller-scale event, Base Camp Plus, featuring live music and comedy will take place on this year's original dates.Download - Scaled backOriginally due to take place on the first weekend of June, Download pulled the plug on 1 March, after it became clear the UK wouldn't emerge from lockdown until later in the summer.However, a smaller-scale event will now take place as part of the government pilot scheme - with 10,000 people camping in Donington Park from 18-20 June.The headline acts are Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes, Enter Shikari and Bullet For My Valentine, with  Creeper, While She Sleeps, Twin Atlantic, Yonaka, Employed to Serve and Neck Deep also in the line-up.Dates have also been announced for the festival's full return in 2022, with KISS (who were due to headline in 2020 and 2021) back at the top of the bill. They'll be joined by Biffy Clyro and Iron Maiden at Donington Castle next June. Tickets for this year's event can be carried over to 2022.Download Festival cancelled for second yearEnd Of The Road - ONWhen: 2-5 SeptemberWhere: Larmer Tree Gardens, WiltshireWho: Hot Chip, Sleaford Mods, Stereolab, King Krule""We were ready for one hell of a party in 2020 so we did our best to keep most of the original line-up,"" said organisers of End Of The Road, who are welcoming back almost 100 artists who were due to play last year's festival. ""It has been a strange year and we'd like to extend the biggest thank-you to everybody who's bought a ticket and stood with us through these tough times.""Although the event has sold out, a few extra tickets will be released in May, with resales available via Twickets.Fairport's Cropredy Convention - OFFWhen: 12-14 AugustWhere: Near Banbury, OxfordshireWho: Fairport Convention, Clannad, Turin BreaksRun by folk-rock legends Fairport Convention, Cropredy is one of the UK's oldest festivals, dating back to 1976.After saying they were ""cautiously confident"" earlier in the year, the band were forced to postpone the event to 2022 in late June.""We have reached the point where we'd need to spend big money but without any certainty we could go ahead,"" said Director Gareth Williams. The dilemma we are facing is simple - proceed and risk potentially going out of business or postpone for a year and live to fight another day.""He added that the lack of Covid-related cancellation insurance, and the failure to provide guidelines for events taking place in step four, had ""made it effectively impossible to plan this year's event"".Glastonbury - OFF / ONLINEThe sheer size of Glastonbury - which features more than 100 stages, thousands of performers and nearly 200,000 fans - meant they had to make a decision on their viability early.The bad news broke in January: ""In spite of our efforts to move heaven and earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the festival happen this year,"" said Michael and Emily Eavis. ""We are so sorry to let you all down.""However, Coldplay, Haim, Damon Albarnm Jorja Smith and Kano all played a ticketed live-stream show from Worthy Farm in May, which won rave reviews despite major technical problems.Organisers have also submitted an application to hold a smaller, one-off concert on Worthy Farm in September, although that show is still unconfirmed.Glastonbury Festival 2021 axed 'with great regret'Glastonbury may hold concert on festival siteGone Wild Festival - ONWhen: 26-29 AugustWhere: Powderham Castle, DevonWho: Kaiser Chiefs, Scouting For Girls, Melanie C, Dick & DomOrganised by Bear Grylls this unusual festival mixes live music with activities such as wakeboarding, bushcraft and coasteering, all in support of the Royal Marines Charity.2021 marks its inaugural year, with Grylls describing it as ""the perfect event for families to experience adventures together"". The Great Escape - ONLINEBrighton's Great Escape normally takes place in May, which made its 2021 edition impossible. The event, which focuses on up-and-coming talent, had previously announced its first 50 (of more than 400) acts, including BBC Sound Of 2021 winner Pa Salieu, and rising star Arlo Parks. However, the line-up has since disappeared from the festival's official website.Instead, the event moved online, with a full schedule of live-streamed concerts and music industry debates. The event will return in full on 11 May 2022.Green Man Festival  - HOPEFULWhen: 19-22 AugustWhere: Brecon Beacons, WalesWho: TBCGreen Man boasts one of the most spectacular backdrops of all the UK's festivals - nestled at the foot of the mountains in Wales' Brecon Beacons National Park. Organisers are hoping this year's event can go ahead, although the Welsh government's plan for emerging from lockdown is more cautious than the English equivalent.In a statement on 28 June, they said: ""Successful test events have taken place in Wales and England, but unfortunately we just don't know when restrictions will be lifted in Wales. We're also awaiting an update on government-backed festival insurance in the case of a forced Covid cancellation. This would be a crucial lifeline.""Information changes daily so we need a bit more time to digest the latest developments and work out how much longer we can continue preparing for the festival in light of recent news.""Further updates are promised in July.Isle Of Wight Festival - RESCHEDULED When: 16-19 SeptemberWhere: Seaclose Park, NewportWho: Liam Gallagher, Snow Patrol, David Guetta and Duran DuranOriginally scheduled for June, the Isle of Wight festival has been pushed back by three months. Organisers announced the ""quartet of iconic names"" taking the main stage and stressed the importance of being a Covid-safe event. ""Over the coming months we'll be watching and learning from the events taking place before us and, of course, liaising with all the relevant authorities to make sure everyone - audience, artists, staff, the community - is kept safe,"" they added.Covid-hit festival pushed back three more monthsKendal Calling - OFFWhen: 29 July-1 AugustWhere: Lowther Deer Park, CumbriaWho: The Streets, Supergrass, Stereophonics, Dizzee Rascal""It breaks our hearts to tell you that our 15th birthday celebrations are postponed once again"".One of the UK's most picturesque festivals, Kendal Calling had been optimistic about its prospects early in the year, telling fans they were ""lucky that our on-site preparations don't begin for some time, unlike some of our much bigger friends in the festival world"", meaning they could be more nimble in reacting to Covid-19 restrictions. After the end to lockdown was delayed, organisers had hoped to keep the festival alive as part of the government's pilot scheme for live events - but they weren't selected for the programme.""Going two summers without a festival is devastating for us,"" they wrote. ""We need the support of our audience now more than ever, and retaining your tickets [for next year] would go the longest way in helping us during this period.""Kendal Calling festival cancelled for second yearLatitude - ONimage captionFriday night will be headlined by Mercury Prize winners Wolf AliceWhen: 22-25 JulyWhere: Henham Park, SuffolkWho:  Bastille, Bombay Bicycle Club, Wolf Alice (pictured),  Chemical BrothersLatitude will take place with a full-capacity audience of 40,000 people as part of the government's Events Research Programme.""The additional research collected at Latitude will benefit all festivals and live events moving forward,"" said festival director Melvin Benn. ""Everyone will be welcome to attend as long as they have a negative lateral flow test or proof of two vaccinations.""The line-up had changed considerably since the festival was first announced, with Swedish headliners First Aid Kit no longer able to attend, and Lewis Capaldi cancelling all upcoming shows. However, Bastille remain in place as Sunday night headliners, with Wolf Alice and Chemical Brothers also on the bill.Latitude organiser 'very certain' it will go aheadLovebox  - MIAFocusing on dance, hip-hop and R&B, London's Lovebox festival was set to expand in 2020 with a new stage, and headline performances by Disclosure; Khalid; Robyn; and Tyler, The Creator.Until recently, the festival's website still carried a banner reading ""see you in 2021"" but the message was updated in May to the more generic, ""Lovebox will return"". Love Supreme - OFFWhen: 2-4 JulyWhere: Glynde Place, East SussexWho: TLC, The Isley Brothers, Sister SledgeThe team at the Love Supreme Jazz Festival say they are ""devastated"" not to be able to go ahead in 2021, despite ""exploring all avenues"" to make the festival happen.""We simply would not be able to deliver a Love Supreme that lives up to our own and your expectations,"" they added.Tickets will automatically transfer to next year; but refunds will also be available. Lytham Festival - OFFWhen: 2022Where: Lytham Green, Lytham St AnnesWho: Lewis Capaldi, Snow Patrol, Duran Duran, Lionel RichieOrganisers announced they were postponing from 2021 having ""explored the possibility of moving the festival later in the year"", which they found was not going to be possible. ""We are now in the process of making some big plans for a triumphant return next year,"" they added. Neighbourhood Weekender - ONWhen: 3-5 SeptemberWhere: Victoria Park, WarringtonWho: James, Sam Fender, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Paul Heaton and Jacqui AbbottWarrington's Neighbourhood Weekender attracted some controversy when Ian Brown pulled out of a headline slot, claiming the event was demanding Covid-19 vaccination as a condition of entry.The event neither confirmed nor denied the claim, simply saying they would ""comply with the conditions outlined by the government"" when the event takes place in September (having been moved from its original date in May).Brown was swiftly replaced by Mancunian indie band James. Fans who cannot make the rescheduled dates can apply for a refund.Noisily Festival - OFFWhen: 8-12 JulyWhere: Coney Woods, LeicestershireWho: Atlantik, Ipcress, Luis MAn underground music festival, Noisily takes place deep in the heart of the Coney Woods - about 15 minutes from Market Harborough. Organisers had initially made a Covid guarantee - saying dates will be rescheduled if government advice changes, and anyone who can't attend rescheduled dates will receive a ""100% refund at face value (minus booking fees)"".But after the government's announcement on 14 June, they had to backtrack on those plans.""Today's announcement was the one that we dreaded,"" they wrote in a statement. ""The wood and fields in which Noisily takes place are part of a working farm, meaning there is no scope to delay until later in the summer"".Describing the loss as ""devastating"", organisers promised the festival would return ""stronger than ever"" in 2022.Notting Hill Carnival - CANCELLEDimage copyrightPA MediaLast year, the Notting Hill Carnival was cancelled for the first time in its history. Organisers were hoping it could be resurrected for its 55th anniversary in 2021, but those hopes have now been dashed. In a statement on 18 June, organisers said this year's Carnival ""will not be on the streets due to the ongoing uncertainty and risk Covid-19 poses"".""This has been an incredibly difficult decision to make. Everyone involved in the event desperately wants a return to the road where Carnival belongs but safety has to come first and with the latest cautious announcement on the government's 'roadmap', this is the only way to ensure that,"" they added.However, they said they were looking at holding ""alternate events that will allow everyone to safely celebrate everything Notting Hill Carnival stands for"", as they did in 2020, and that next year they hope to put on the ""greatest ever"" Carnival. Nozstock: The Hidden Valley - POSTPONEDWhen: 22-25 JulyWhere: Rowden Paddocks, HerefordshireWho: Sister Sledge, Bill Bailey, Utah SaintsWhat started as a humble barbecue for family and friends in 1998 has turned into a fully-fledged festival with 11 stages and some of the biggest acts in the world dropping into Pete and Ella Nosworthy's farm in Herefordshire.Although they initially hoped to proceed with this year's event, they were forced to pull the plug.In a statement, Ella said the financial consequences of pressing ahead ""could affect Nozstock's future and we simply cannot take that risk"".""We are all devastated,"" she added. ""The support from loyal Nozstockers combined with selling out so quickly gave some hope for this year which makes this postponement even harder.""One in the Woods - ON / POSTPONEDWhen: 21-22 AugustWhere: Orrell Hill Wood, LiverpoolWho: Sub Focus, Jeff Mills, FrictionA brand new festival for 10,000 people in the ""enchanted realm"" of Hightown, near Liverpool, One In The Woods focuses on dance, techno and drum and bass.Originally scheduled for 17-18 July, organisers swiftly booked new dates for August as soon as the government delayed the end of lockdown restrictions.

Benn said that, on that front, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""got it right"".""I applaud him for that, and I am going to hold his feet to the fire on it. And I think there's going to be 200,000 young people holding his feet to the fire on that position as well.""Reading and Leeds festivals 'to go ahead'Rewind Festival - ON (ENGLAND) / OFF (SCOTLAND)image copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionKeren and Sara have kept the band going as a duo since 1992When: Throughout AugustWhere: Scone Palace, Perth; Capesthorne Hall, Macclesfield; Temple Island Meadows, Henley-On-ThamesWho: Jimmy Somerville, Wet Wet Wet, Billy Ocean, Soul II Soul, Bananarama (pictured)After cancelling in 2020, Rewind said it had started ""planning with confidence"" for 2021 after the UK government revealed its four-step process for emerging from lockdown. Organisers of the 80s throwback festival even joked they'd formed their own SAGE committee - comprised of Sad Aged Gits from the Eighties.The Perth leg of the festival was cancelled in April, based on guidance from the Scottish Parliament, but the two English concerts will go ahead as planned.Shrewsbury Folk Festival - ONWhen: 27-30 AugustWhere: West Midlands Showground, ShrewsburyWho: Kate Rusby, Oysterband, Show of HandsOrganisers said they have plans in place for a ""Covid-safe festival, including a refreshed line-up, to celebrate the best of British-based folk artists"".They added: ""We have elected for outside stages and more outdoor activities, to ensure we can meet any possible Covid-related regulations that might be in place by August Bank Holiday.""Slam Dunk - ONWhen: 4-5 September Where: Temple Newsam and Hatfield Park, LeedsWho: Sum 41, Don Broco, While She SleepsUsually kicking off the summer festival season, Slam Dunk Festival organisers have made the decision to push back their event from its usual May bank holiday weekend.""We feel the guidance now is clear enough to know the event will happen in September,"" says festival director Ben Ray.

If the worst comes to the worst, tickets will carry over to next year. Splendour in Nottingham - OFFWhen: 24 JulyWhere: Wollaton Park, NottinghamWho: Richard Ashcroft, Supergrass, Rick Astley""We're devastated that we're having to postpone for a second year running,"" said organisers in a statement on 23 June.

""We are incredibly grateful to our staff, artists and suppliers who have worked tirelessly with us to get to this point.""Trenchard said he was confident the festival could take place after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England was ""very likely"" to emerge from Covid restrictions on 19 July.However, he also called on Johnson to provide more support to the live music sector, saying: ""Now is the time for government to go beyond words of confidence and finally step forward with the long called-for government-backed insurance for the festival sector.""Sundown - ONWhen: 3-5 SeptemberWhere: Norfolk Showground, NorwichWho: Loyle Carner, Sean Paul, Becky Hill, FredoComing at the tail end of festival season, Norfolk's ""bass and pop"" festival looks more hopeful than most - and has already sold out.

Festival boss Geoff Ellis explained the date change was down to ""a combination of the timetable to exit lockdown and the preparation time needed to put on an event of TRNSMT's scale"". But he was optimistic, saying the delay ""gives us the opportunity to put on the best festival we can for our fans after such a long time without any live music"", and added: ""We will, of course, work with all relevant authorities to ensure we follow any guidelines that may be in place in September.""Truck Festival  - OFFWhen: 23-25 JulyWhere: Hill Farm, OxfordshireWho: Bombay Bicycle Club, The Kooks, Royal Blood, Pale Waves""The Godfather of the small festival scene,"" Oxford's Truck festival sold out before the line-up had even been announced.But after the government delayed the end to lockdown, organisers took the difficult decision to cancel for a second year running.""It's the news that many expected but few wanted,"" they said in a statement.

50 Reasons to Love the WorldMenuLoading50 Reasons to Love the WorldThe war correspondent walking the worldShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: John Stanmeyer/National Geographic)By Neeta Lal30th March 2021For the last eight years, journalist Paul Salopek has been walking around the world, tracing the ancient path of human migration.50 Reasons to Love the World - 2021Why do you love the world?
""Because walking makes every square metre of the Earth that I stand on my home: in no village, road or continent do I feel lonely."" – Paul Salopek, journalist
More Reasons to Love the WorldTwo-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and National Geographic Fellow Paul Salopek is documenting the world on his global, multi-year Out of Eden Walk. Since January 2013, the 59-year-old American has been walking from Africa along the ancient path of human migration, which started between 50,000 and 80,000 years ago.The journalist’s more than 38,000km odyssey across 36 countries will extend from Ethiopia to Argentina, passing through west Asia, the Silk Road, India, China, Siberia and the west coast of North and South America before terminating at Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America. So far, he has covered 12,000km and is currently stuck in Myanmar due to a pandemic-induced border clampdown.A scientist by training, Salopek says his project is about storytelling; an experiment in slow and immersive journalism. Through the Out of Eden Walk, he aims to gather knowledge in a slower way, at a more human pace, infusing his work with richer, deeper insights into the landscapes and lives of the people he encounters.We recently caught up with Salopek to ask him how Covid has affected his travels, what inspires him to keep walking and what he wants the legacy of his voyage to be.Q: We interviewed you six years ago, two years into your walk, when you were in eastern Turkey. Does your trip seem any more important or urgent in light of some of the recent challenges the planet has faced?Like almost everyone, I’ve been affected by the pandemic. Borders are closed. Movement is restricted. I’ve paused the walk in northern Myanmar, waiting for things to open back up. Fortunately, among the things that walking teaches is patience.Saudi Arabia's ancient Nabataean ruins of Madain Salih were carved into sandstone outcrops some 2,000 years ago (Credit: John Stanmeyer/National Geographic)In my immediate horizons, not much has changed. Farmers are cultivating rice. Lorries bump along jungle roads bringing the next consignment of beer and taking away river fish or timber. I’m lucky. Myanmar has a very low morbidity and mortality rate. The reasons are not entirely known and probably complicated. They may include some background level of resistance because humans and wild coronaviruses have been coexisting in this tropical environment for millennia. Because of this, a geneticist friend calls this the ""pangolin belt"".I’m not sure Covid makes my journey’s messages more urgent. It might make them more pertinent. Pandemics highlight our interdependency. We won’t heal until everybody heals. Our safety is communal.Q: Travelling and storytelling come naturally to you as a foreign correspondent. Is that what inspired you to do this journey, and can you tell us what inspires you to keep walking?This project is about storytelling. Walking is just the antique vehicle for that mission.Ancient Greek bards. West African griots. Confucian walking scholars in China. The human habit of combining foot travel with narrative, learning and sharing culture is very old. It is a tradition found in many parts of the world.You may also be interested in: • Vandana Shiva on why the food we eat matters • The nation without access to its own sea • The indigenous recipe for living wellI was a conventional foreign correspondent for years, zipping between breaking stories by plane or car. The advent of the Information Revolution has only sped up that whole process. Our stories today move at the speed of light. So, the Out of Eden Walk is a bit of pushback against all that. It aims to gather knowledge in a slower way, at a more humane pace, at the rate that these Stone Age brains that we’re still carrying around were designed to process – at 5km/h.By slowing down my reporting process, my work is hopefully infused with richer, deeper insights into the landscapes and lives of the people I encounter. Walking bakes in the added element of time. It connects one story to another in a primal way. It encourages you to think before writing. I call it ""slow journalism"", but it’s just our oldest form of discovery.What keeps me going? The stories I encounter. They’re never-ending and no two are alike. Each one raises a new question.Paul Salopek’s Out of Eden Walk started in Africa and will cover more than 38,000km across 36 countries (Credit: Ryan Morris/National Geographic)Q: What made you decide to trace the ancient path of human migration? I’m a scientist by training. I studied genetics, archaeology and human origins. It always struck me how closely interrelated global human populations are. Those of us residing outside of Africa only dispersed out of the mother continent yesterday, biologically speaking. And I’ve also been intrigued about how incredibly little is actually known about that first peopling of the world. It’s by far the greatest tale of human achievement in our species’ 300,000-year history – the exploration of an entire planet, mostly on foot. It’s the journey that made us the problem-solving creatures we are today.Pandemics highlight our interdependency. We won’t heal until everybody heals.Since all of us contributed to that original discovery somehow, because some common ancestor must have walked part of those trails, following the old dispersal routes serves as a unifying narrative through-line. It’s a reminder that [the English poet] Donne was right. Our fates are entwined, probably now more than ever. You're a fool if you believe that whatever happens in America or Myanmar won’t somehow touch you.Q: Following on from this, has the Black Lives Matter movement had any impact on your trip and on what you’re trying to show through your work?I’m a very privileged nomad. I’m male, white and backed by powerful institutions such as the National Geographic Society. I was going to add that I carry a viable passport, but that’s not really the case anymore, is it? In any case, I walk the Earth by choice, not out of necessity, like most of the estimated one billion migrants on the move across the globe today – war refugees, economic migrants and those fleeing the destruction of the climate crisis.I try my best to convey this position within my storytelling. It’s actually hard not to. Walking is a humbling experience. But that’s also its main strength. Think about it. When you move constantly, year after year, on foot, through the lands of strangers, it’s hard to ""other"" unknown people you encounter because, often, your life literally depends on them. I would be dead now without the mercy of strangers.You soon learn that people everywhere are concerned by 95% of the same things. We all talk about the same issues. Love or its absence. The fates of our children. Hate the boss. And, increasingly, the ominous climate.In remote Uzbekistan, Paul Salopek and his guide traversed a Silk Road wilderness that hadn't seen foot travellers for generations (Credit: John Stanmeyer/National Geographic)What’s happening with Black Lives Matter, it seems to me, involves a lot of long overdue reckonings about an American caste system and its fossilised injustice. But it’s also a huge chance to listen. I mean really listen. That’s its rare power. This is what I tell students following my journey. I’m listening as much as walking my way across the world. It’s what all decent storytellers do, of course. But I’d argue it’s a form of prayer. Listening is an act of human reclamation.Q: You spent many months in India walking along the country’s great rivers, such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra. What did you learn about this country and its people? The route in India lasted 16 months and calipered almost 4,000km across the country’s north. What you learn on foot is that every village is a cosmos, with [its] own personality and issues. That said, what I chose to focus on in my work was water. India is a riverland. Every one of its rivers is a deity. Yet the country is undergoing a silent water calamity – shortages, pollution – that impacts a staggering 600 million people. That’s a whole lot of human woe and the problem is so colossal that few can even look at it squarely. The government certainly isn’t; it’s still relying on 19th-Century British plans to reroute entire rivers. Good luck with that. As one of my walking partners, the amazing environmental photographer Arati Kumar-Rao says, the place is in massive denial.On the human level, India is a very congenial place to walk. That’s because millions of people still do it. Farmers leave clay water pots at roadsides for pedestrians to drink, and some communities still have dharamshalas, or pilgrim guest houses. The boom of Indian traffic still echoes in my ears.Q: Documenting your journey is an important part of the process. How are you recording and sharing what you see, and what do you want the legacy of your walk to be?I write weekly or fortnightly dispatches, and the people who walk with me – the project’s walking partners – also contribute their own storytelling. Most of this material appears on the National Geographic website. There are ""milestones"" that I record every 100 miles (160km) of displacement along the walk. There are narrative maps. There are photo galleries and videos. My editor calculated that the current rate of production, the journey is on track to produce a million words of text. My walking partners and I also conduct workshops en route in ""slow journalism"".Paul Salopek walked almost 4,000km across north India, reporting on the nation's silent water calamity (Credit: John Stanmeyer/National Geographic)I think that this educational mission will be the journey’s real legacy. Nothing would make me happier than to leave a multicultural community of thoughtful storytellers in my wake. In that way, the journey continues via others long after I hang up my boots in Tierra del Fuego.Q: The world is an amazing place. Tell us about some of the things that have made you fall in love with our planet as you walk?I think walking teaches about the world in an ideal way. The horizons are earned. You live within your body’s limitations – marking progress by the length of your stride. It keeps you grounded, humble. Like a lot of things that are good in life – love, friendship, food, conversation – the slowness of it is essential. There is a sort of sacrament of days. You wake up, have a cup of tea, pack your rucksack and move on. At sunset you carry out this process in reverse, savouring it. Walking reacquaints you with the forgotten ceremonies of arrivals and departures. These are daily rituals that motorised transport, speed, schedules, have obliterated. And you wake up to every sky not knowing where you will sleep next, yet with a steadying directionality to your life: east. You experience a continuity in life that I think must have been our original state. The world slides by, your waking hours balance between alertness and daydreaming.Q: What challenges have you faced in planning your route? And where are you headed to next?Around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, when the first modern humans began roaming out of Africa in earnest, the main obstacles were deserts or oceans or ice caps. For me, the big hurdles today are artificial – political borders. I wasn’t able to get a visa to walk through Iran or Turkmenistan, two countries that are important centres of human migration and culture. I walked around them.Now I’m waiting for borders closed by the pandemic to reopen, hopefully in the month or two. Then I’ll walk from Myanmar to China. Walking across China, a country whose incredible environmental and cultural diversity often gets flattened in the media, will be one of the highlights of the global trek. I look forward to it much in the manner of the old Confucian scholars, who pursued a well-lived life through the exercise of dé 德 (potency, virtuosity) while engaged in an activity labelled yóu 遊 (wandering).This segment of the trail will cover more than 6,000km and take about a year and half.As part of his journey, Paul Salopek writes weekly or fortnightly dispatches and conducts workshops in slow journalism (Credit: John Stanmeyer/National Geographic)Q: An aim of your walk is to connect with local people, but your journey also sounds as though it could be fairly isolating. Can you tell us about the people who have both helped and accompanied you on your walk?From [the] beginning of the walk in Ethiopia, I have moved with local walking partners. At first, this was for logistical reasons mainly – for navigational help, and interpreting interviews. But I quickly discovered that walking with people through their own homelands became a fundamental pillar of the project itself. Without them, I would learn much less, be able [to] share much less with readers, and in general have a diminished experience of the journey.Nothing would make me happier than to leave a multicultural community of thoughtful storytellers in my wakeThis is especially true about walking with women. They help open the doors to the stories of half the human species and contribute a crucial perspective of their own that I can’t often access, especially in conservative rural societies. My walking partners – and they include Ethiopian camel pastoralists, American palaeontologists, retired Saudi army officers, Turkish landscape photographers, Georgian high school students and amazing Indian writers, among many others – are like family. We now incorporate their stories of the walk into the fabric of the narrative. In this way, the walk is building a global community of narrators, artists, thinkers who will be the real legacy of this lunatic jaunt.
Q: What is the first thing you’ll do after completing your journey?
Walking teaches by taking away expectation. I have no idea.

MenuLoadingComeback Cities | HistoryWhy Tunis could be the new RomeShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: fivepointsix/Getty Images)By Erin Clare Brown27th January 2020Tunis is bursting with the creative energy of a generation taking full advantage of its newfound freedom of expression and fervour for preserving its heritage in unexpected ways.TThe wait for admission to the Colosseum was approximately three and a half hours. The queue was so long that I initially mistook it for the line leading into the Palatine Hill, as I couldn’t even see the Colosseum when I joined the end of it. It was pouring rain and bitter cold in the middle of May, yet scores of soggy tourists were huddled alongside me in technicolour rain ponchos waiting for the chance to pay €12 (around £10) to be herded into the great arena like wild animals before a gladiatorial hunt. That was when it struck me: in about as much time as it would take to wait in that queue, I could ride the metro to Rome’s airport, hop an 80-minute flight to Tunis and catch a cab 15km to Carthage, where, for a mere 12 Tunisian dinars (£3.30) I could be blissfully alone with equally impressive relics of Roman engineering and architecture.Later that week, I decided to give it a try.The Antonine Baths in Tunis is one of the largest Roman thermal sites in the world (Credit: DC_Columbia/Getty Images)Tunisia has suffered a crisis of reputation over the past decade after the revolution that ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 threw the country into turmoil and began the broader Arab Spring. What had once been a regular haunt for holidaymakers and European artists and intellectuals (Paul Klee, Michel Foucault and Simone de Beauvoir all spent extended stays here) suddenly seemed fierce and untouchable. Those that did venture here often did so in the insulated safety of all-inclusive package tours, which kept them in the close confines of seaside sanctuaries like the Mövenpick resort and spa in Sousse.  Tunisia’s reputation was further damaged by a pair of terror attacks in 2015 at the height of ISIS’s international campaign that roiled the country and prompted a major overhaul of anti-terrorism initiatives. The UK government still suggests tourists exercise caution in the region, but notes that “The Tunisian government has improved protective security in major cities and tourist resorts.”You may also be interested in: • The most inviting city in Africa? • South America's coolest comeback city • The shipwreck that created a countryDespite this bump on the road to democracy, now more than ever is the perfect time to visit the Tunisian capital, and to do so on your own terms. The country has emerged from the Arab Spring with a functioning democracy, a stabilising economy and a hunger for tourism. It’s currently the only Arab nation with freedom of expression, and the capital buzzes with young people expressing new ideas through concerts, political rallies, art shows and film festivals, which just a decade earlier would have been impossible.There are still ancient Roman and Punic ruins to explore, beaches to enjoy and incredible arts and crafts to bargain for, all unencumbered by crowds. What’s most exciting is that Tunis is bursting with the creative energy of a generation taking full advantage of its newfound freedom of expression and fervour for preserving its heritage in new and unexpected ways.Tunis' vibrant Medina is home to artisans and hawkers selling local handicrafts (Credit: Erin Clare Brown)One of the locals leading this charge is Leila Ben Gacem, a social entrepreneur who is committed to saving local crafts and artistry that were at risk of disappearing.“When people travel, they want a story, they want to be part of something,” Ben Gacem told me over a plate of roasted lamb and aubergine in the elaborately tiled courtyard of Dar Ben Gacem Kahia, one of two medieval homes in the vibrant medina of Tunis that she has painstakingly renovated into guesthouses over the last decade.When people travel, they want a story, they want to be part of somethingBen Gacem knows a story when she sees one. After a career working as an engineer around Europe and North Africa, she grew sceptical of foreign investment and development and returned to Tunisia in 2013 to see if she could encourage economic growth by preserving cultural heritage rather than replacing it. She spent months seeking out and listening to the stories of hundreds of artisans in Tunis’ Unesco World Heritage-listed Medina – shoemakers, perfumers, woodworkers, bookbinders, milliners, weavers – and founded a leading grassroots organisation, Blue Fish, to help them keep their businesses afloat and their crafts alive.  One way to do that: bring the buyers to them. “Our local market is too small to preserve our arts and crafts,” she told me. But by restoring historic homes as guest houses, she’s brought thousands of visitors from around the world into the workshops and storefronts of the Medina’s artisans. The marble floor tiles at Dar Ben Gacem Kahia had to be individually removed to install modern plumbing (Credit: Erin Clare Brown)“At first the artisans didn’t understand why people wanted to see their workshops or watch them make hats or slippers,” she said, but now it’s become a symbiotic relationship. Guests receive a customised map with the locations of dozens of workshops and shops full of handmade leather goods, rugs, perfumes and treasures that make for very happy hunting in the warren of souks. As a result, they seek out and support micro businesses that are keeping Tunisian heritage alive. Ben Gacem also put a small army of craftsmen to work restoring the guesthouses. It took seven years for the gypsum carvers, ceramicists, wood workers and stone layers to restore the first guest house to its former glory. Like the rest of the enchanting Medina, every element of the buildings has a story, from the broad marble slabs on the floor of the courtyard (“We had to remove and label them, one by one, to put in the plumbing,” she told me) to the mismatched columns that were likely repurposed from Roman ruins by the Arabs who founded the Medina in the 7th Century.Ben Gacem believes that Tunis’ cultural heritage shouldn’t just be preserved, it should be passed down. The guesthouses have become hubs for culture, hosting dinners, lectures and concerts that are open to the public and full of locals from the neighbourhood. She also encourages young artisans to take up apprenticeships and trains local teens in the hospitality industry, so that the cultural legacy of the Medina will stay in the hands of its residents.While Ben Gacem works to preserve culture inside the Medina, outside its walls a swell of young Tunisians is redefining that cultural heritage through arts, music and design. Among the standouts is Anissa Meddeb, who blends Tunisian textiles and Asian influences to create fresh, fashion-forward clothing for her brand Anissa Aida. Born and raised in Paris to Tunisian parents, Meddeb studied fashion in New York before deciding to move to Tunis to start her own line.Tunis’ Medina is a warren of narrow streets, souks, mosques and historical structures (Credit: Dark_Eni/Getty Images)When she first got started in 2016, she said it was tough finding quality fabric in a sea of fast-fashion polyester. So she scoured the small towns in Tunisia to find the best silk, linen and cotton weavers to collaborate with. “I wanted to get back to the roots of artisans,” Meddeb said. It took her months to find the right partners, but now she commissions fabrics from across the country for her line, which is sold in local boutiques like Musk & Amber as well as in shops across Europe.When I asked Meddeb why a rising design star would move from a fashion mecca to Tunis, she was clear: “There’s an energy in Tunis now, especially with younger artists. People have something to say.”There’s an energy in Tunis now, especially with younger artists. People have something to say.For travellers looking to tap into that energy, and the beautiful design that goes with it, head to the neighbourhoods north of downtown Tunis. Closest to the city centre, in Mutuelleville, stop by L’artisanerie for hand-woven plant hangers and decorated mirrors, then visit Mooja and Elyssa Artisanat to try on the latest in Tunisian fashion. In the trendy La Marsa neighbourhood, you’ll find contemporary pottery in a fresh black-and-white palette at Noa Atelier; a floor-to-ceiling selection of handwoven foutas (a traditional towel perfect for the beach or your guest bathroom) at Hager Fouta; and streetwear with cheeky phrases like “The Harissa People” (a nod to Tunisia’s piping-hot chilli paste) in Arabic calligraphy at Lyoum. Finish your tour in the seaside neighbourhood of Sidi Bou Said, where, tucked among the charming blue-and-white houses, you’ll find Rock the Kasbah, a quirky homewares store built into a traditional house.But great design isn’t the only thing you’ll find dotted among the luxurious houses and charming villages along the northern coast. It is also where you’ll find those world-class Roman ruins I escaped the Eternal City to find.The seaside neighbourhood of Sidi Bou Said has a distinctive blue-and-white colour scheme (Credit: efesenko/Getty Images)Long before there was Tunis, there was Carthage, the ancient Phoenician port city that was Rome’s arch-rival for centuries. In the epic poem the Aeneid, the Roman poet Virgil tells how Carthage’s founder, queen Dido, fled Tyre in present-day Lebanon and landed in North Africa. When she pleaded for a scrap of land from the leader of the local tribe, he tossed an ox hide on the ground, saying she could have the land the hide covered. In a deft move of both semantics and surgery, she sliced the hide into thin ribbons and encircled an entire hill just above the port with it. This is Byrsa Hill, the best place to start a day of exploring the Punic and Roman ruins of Carthage.At first glance, Byrsa Hill, which is dotted with villas and mansions, looks more like Beverly Hills than a Unesco World Heritage site. But unlike Beverly Hills, if you want to put a pool in your Byrsa backyard, you better call an archaeologist first. For centuries, one civilisation after another built homes on this piece of prime real estate, and digging just a few metres down can turn up African red slip pottery or the remains of a Roman mosaic.While the hilltop offers sweeping views of the Mediterranean Sea and a few Punic and Roman-era ruins, its main attraction, The Carthage Museum, is closed for renovation until further notice. Instead, stick to the sites at the foot of the hill: one ticket gets you into all eight major sites, which are within walking distance or a short cab ride.My favourite of the eight is the Tophet, or Punic, cemetery. It may be one of Carthage’s more diminutive sites, but its grisly history lends it an outsized role. Here, the ancient Phoenicians offered child sacrifices to the goddess Tanit and commemorated each one by erecting a sacrificial stone engraved with her image: a circle perched on a triangle, with outstretched arms. Dozens of these stones are clustered among a grotto of palms, in a placid but eerie scene.Just two hours’ drive south-west of Tunis, the ancient remains of Dougga are startlingly complete (Credit: aprilante/Getty Images)Just up the road, the Antonine Baths cut a more imposing figure. The series of sand-coloured arches and marble pillars were part of a cistern and public bath constructed during the Roman era, one of the largest ever made. The complex is so vast that on my last visit I watched a lone Tunisian boy scout spend nearly 20 minutes trying to find his troop in a game of Sardines.For those with an even greater hunger for ancient history (and a rental car on hand), a day trip to Dougga is well worth the effort. Just two hours’ drive south-west of the capital, Dougga is the best preserved Roman city in North Africa. The vast Unesco complex, with its imposing Roman forum and temple, stands alone on a hill overlooking vast plains bursting with yellow wildflowers in the spring and amber grain throughout summer and autumn. You can spend hours wandering through the warren of well-preserved streets, imagining what life in the Roman town must have been like, and do it with the peace one can never find in Europe. Both times I visited, in April and June, I had the place entirely to myself.Tunis may not have Rome beat in every category (the food, which is heavy on a trifecta of eggs, tinned tuna and harissa, often leaves something to be desired), but it doesn’t have to. As Tunis folds its past into its future, it is creating its own legacy as a capital of culture, history and freedom.Comeback Cities is a BBC Travel series that showcases under-the-radar capitals, champions the urban underdogs and revels in the success stories of cities that have turned their fortunes around.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".

MenuLoadingAdventure & Experience | DesertAn exhilarating train journey across the SaharaShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: mauritius images GmbH/Alamy)By Alastair Gill5th September 2019Since 1963, Mauritania’s 2km-long Train du Desert has carried iron ore and brave passengers 704km across the Sahara Desert.WWrapping my Touareg scarf around my face to shield my eyes from the sand and dirt, I climbed the ladder, hoisted myself onto the lip of the freight wagon and surveyed the scene. An endless line of wagons stretched out to the horizon, rocking and swaying. To either side, a landscape of boundless sandy plains and low dunes was sliding past, pin-sharp in the limpid light of the Sahara. Figures sat atop the wagons ahead, facing into the wind, yelling to each other in Arabic above the deafening noise.One might imagine travelling through the Sahara by train to be a zen-like voyage. In some ways it is – but it is also an unforgiving and ceaseless assault on the body and senses. The booming and grinding; the constant tremors rippling through the body; the grit swirling through your hair in the hot breeze; the desert sun pricking your eyelids.Mauritania’s Train du Desert travels 704km from Nouadhibou to Zouerat (Credit: Alastair Gill)Opened in 1963, Mauritania’s Train du Desert operates a daily service from the port at Nouadhibou on the Atlantic coast to the iron ore mines in Zouerat in the country’s north-west. The full journey, which runs along the border of the disputed territory of Western Sahara, takes around 20 hours and covers a total distance of 704km. More than 2km long, the train is made up of three or four diesel locomotives, one passenger carriage and between 200 and 210 freight cars. When loaded on the westward journey to Nouadhibou, each car can carry up to 84 tons of iron ore.You may also be interested in:• A 1,860km journey across Africa• From Africa to tea with the Queen• A Myanmar rail journey not to be missedThe train also carries passengers to and from distant desert communities, cutting up to 500km off the inconvenient journey by road, which involves a lengthy detour south to Nouakchott, Mauritania’s capital. Many Mauritanians choose – like my companion Mike and I had done – to forgo the overcrowded passenger carriage and ride “second-class” in the freight cars, free of charge. It is a noisy, dirty and dangerous journey: falls are common, and the temperature can reach well over 40C during the day.Hardly strangers to discomfort, Mike and I had endured sweaty trains, rickety bunkhouses and hikes through mosquito-infested swamps in subarctic Russia. But this steel desert caravan was a new lesson in austerity – an empty, open-topped metal box, completely exposed to a constant elemental symphony of heat, wind and noise.The train is a lifeline for many of Mauritania’s remote desert communities (Credit: Novarc Images/Alamy)“It’s one of the longest trains in the world,” my father would tell us at the dinner table. “Imagine travelling hundreds of miles into the Sahara desert in a cargo wagon, then getting off before dawn in the middle of the desert, praying you’ve got the right stop. Then, just as the sun’s coming up, a jeep comes over the brow of the hill.”As a child, I was fascinated by the story of my parents’ journey on the iron ore train, a mysterious adventure that seemed incompatible with the world I knew. In 1971, they had sailed from the Canary Islands to a port in what is now Western Sahara, then travelled south down the coast into Mauritania. Somewhere along the way they heard it was possible to catch a freight train into the country’s austere interior, to settlements that were once stops on ancient Saharan trade routes. They disembarked roughly 400km inland at Choum, where a dirt road leads to the market town of Atar and the medieval holy city of Chinguetti.The only visual record of their experience was a single Kodak slide, a relic of a pre-digital age in which every frame counted: figures in a sun-drenched freight car, peering over the rim into a sandy infinity. I never forgot that image, and often dreamt of riding the iron ore train myself one day.Decades later, I was sitting atop a steel wagon, rolling into the Sahara. Mike and I would attempt to retrace my parents’ journey by disembarking at Choum then going on to Atar and Chinguetti. For me this was to be a kind of homage to the spirit of my parents; the realisation of a childhood dream; the closing of a circle.Measuring more than 2km, Mauritania’s Train du Desert is one of the longest trains in the world (Credit: Rachel Carbonell/Alamy)In Nouadhibou, a fortunate encounter prepared us for the realities of life aboard the train. Aiba, our hotel receptionist, turned out to be invaluable. His dark eyes brightened when we told him of our plans. “Ah, the train! I’ve travelled on it so many times,” he exclaimed. “My father works in the mines at Zouerat.”Aiba gave us plastic bags and tape to cocoon our backpacks from the dirt and dust that would be swirling around us. Then he drove us to the station and ensured we boarded the wagon that would stop closest to our station. Given the length of the train and the tiny scale of the settlements where it stops, a traveller could end up walking more than a kilometre to reach the station on arrival if they choose their wagon unwisely.There was an odd contradiction in passing through the vast spaces of the Sahara inside a windowless steel box just 8m by 4m. So whenever the wagon began to seem too claustrophobic, we would haul ourselves up the ladders in the corners and spend a while perched on the rim in our robes, watching the dunes and scrub scroll by.Many Mauritanians choose to ride in the freight cars free of charge (Credit: Novarc Images/Alamy)Late in the afternoon, the train began to lose speed. The blinding oblong of sky above us had weakened in intensity as the winter sun slipped lower, and most of our wagon was now in shadow. Eventually the train came to a halt in the middle of a lonely plain, stretched out in a wide curve hundreds of wagons long.People climbed down and began to congregate at the rear of the train, exchanging handshakes and greetings. Others hung back on the peripheries or watched silently from the windows of the dirt-streaked passenger carriage, an old European-built model with the inscription “Le Train du Desert” unfurling across it. It was a convivial scene that seemed oddly out of place, as if they were chatting in a theatre foyer during an intermission rather than travelling through the desert on a cargo train.Imagine travelling hundreds of miles into the Sahara desert in a cargo wagon, then getting off before dawn in the middle of the desert, praying you’ve got the right stopAmong them were the traders occupying the wagons ahead of us; black Africans and Arabs alike, lean young men in leather jackets and sportswear. We had seen them at Nouadhibou, hauling overstuffed bags onto the train. Then there were older men, presumably Bidan Moors from the country’s upper caste, standing aloof in their billowing white and azure boubou robes, their heads swaddled in Touareg headscarves.The motley composition of the group reflected the complex ethnic realities of Mauritania, a country that sits at the fault line between the Arab and Sub-Saharan worlds and truly belongs to neither. Life in this nation, which only outlawed slavery in 1981, continues to be governed by a strict caste system in which there is little social contact between the paler Bidan elite and the Haratin underclass, largely composed of Mauritanians of Berber and African descent.As I mingled with fellow passengers, the train’s role as an overland link between Nouadhibou and the remote desert communities of central Mauritania became ever clearer. Abdurahman, a young man with striking Moorish features and an intense gaze, informed me solemnly that he and his friends were travelling to Zouerat to look for work. An older man named Mohammed was on his way to visit his son in Atar, as he did several times a year.Riding in the freight cars is an extreme endeavor, as temperatures in the Sahara can reach well over 40C (Credit: Alastair Gill)As the sun sank, some walked out into the desert to pray, while others sprawled on the soft sand. Eventually a blast of the horn from the locomotive signalled that it was time to move on, and the passengers hastily sought the safety of the train, like sailors returning to their vessel.Later, as darkness enveloped the landscape and the air grew chilly, the train’s human cargo hunkered down in their wagons. Soon the sky above us was glittering with stars. Mike laid out a blanket in a part of the wagon that was free of dirt, then we slumped down and tried to sleep, wrapped in Berber robes. Later, shivering in the cold, we understood why this area was clear of dust – not only was it the cleanest spot, it was also the windiest. We swiftly relocated to the dirtiest corner.In the middle of the night, tired of fruitless efforts to sleep, I sat up. The train was standing idle in the moonlight. A stillness seemed to have fallen across the world. Outside, the windows of the passenger carriage several wagons behind us were throwing an eerie halo of light into the darkened desert. In the distance, jagged black mountains rose incongruously out of the endless flat sands. I imagined my parents all those years ago, wondering anxiously if this was where they needed to disembark.Then a whoosh, a roar and several gigantic locomotives shot by in the other direction. Wagons heaped with dark hills of iron ore thundered past, bathed eerily in the glow of our passenger carriage. I picked out three figures, crouched around a charcoal heater; then herds of goats, standing motionless on the ore. Seconds later, the wagons were gone, leaving only clouds of slowly settling dust. Our train jolted to life again.Many who ride Mauritania’s Train du Desert are travelling to and from the cities in search of work or to visit family (Credit: dbimages/Alamy)Around 12 hours after leaving Nouadhibou, we shuddered to a halt in the frigid darkness at Choum. For a few seconds there was silence, then voices and torchlight. We peered over the lip of the wagon. Headlights were lazily swimming in the gloom below, and the sounds of urgent activity issued from the neighbouring wagons. Knowing we had only a few minutes, we hastily hauled our bags down the ladder to where an ancient Peugeot was waiting.A wrinkled face leaned out of the window: “Atar? Atar?” We gratefully tumbled in. Beside us, the wagons began to roll again, booming past us through the dust before vanishing into the night. The driver, who seemed to have mistaken us for locals in our robes, began chattering away in Arabic, but the gentle motion of the car soon lulled me to sleep.The journey from Nouadhibou to Zouerat takes up to 20 hours (Credit: mauritius images GmbH/Alamy)In a guesthouse in Chinguetti the next evening, fronds of date palms whispering above us, my head still reverberated with the roar and rattle of rolling stock. I half-recalled fumbling with documents at police checkpoints in the darkness, wandering the dust-blown streets of Atar at dawn, stealing a couple of hours’ sleep on a carpet in the bare back room of a taxi garage, then bumping across a rocky wasteland in a creaking car, Mike dozing against the window.Chinguetti was a place of fascinating dislocation, its ancient libraries and nameless streets collapsing slowly into piles of stones amid an endless sea of billowing golden dunes. Out of time, it was an elegiac picture of vanished glory, a place that was slowly forgetting itself.And in the following days, as we languished here amid the ruins, the train that had brought us came to seem less and less real, as if the whole experience had just been the product of some feverish, chaotic dream, or perhaps an imaginary memory whose details were already beginning to blur imperceptibly with those of my parents’ journey all those years ago.

MenuLoadingLiving InHow a country reclaimed its rightful nameShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Thomas Cockrem/Alamy)By Lindsey Galloway21st January 2019Last April, Swaziland’s King Mswati III made a surprise announcement: the African country would again be known by its indigenous name, eSwatini.FFor Swaziland’s 50th anniversary of independence from British rule last April, the country’s King Mswati III made a surprise announcement: the African country would no longer be called by its colonial name. Instead, the land would again be known by its indigenous name, eSwatini, meaning ‘the land of the Swazis’.The announcement didn’t come without some initial confusion. “In siSwati, translated literally, the king said ‘the kingdom of eSwatini will now be known as the kingdom of eSwatini’.” said Jessica Elliott, an American who writes the travel blog How Dare She, who was present for the Golden Jubilee event. “It wasn't until the English translation was spoken over the speakers that people understood and reacted. It got a surprised, but enthusiastic applause.”In April 2018, Swaziland’s King Mswati III announced that the country would be known as eSwatini, meaning ‘the land of the Swazis’ (Credit: Keren Su/China Span/Alamy)You may also be interested in:• The capital city older than Rome• Europe’s city of unexpected surprises• Want to live in a well-run country?Jiggs Thorne, who was born in eSwatini and founded the country’s annual Bushfire Music Festival, was also surprised, but pleased the country reclaimed its rightful name. “Country name changes are not a common occurrence of course,” he said. “The change hasn’t impacted our festival but is probably most apparent when we attend music expos as a festival from eSwatini and most of the delegates have no idea of who we are and where we are from.”Though marketing the new name has been challenging as the rest of the world learns it, residents are overwhelmingly pleased with the change. We talked to some of them to understand the pride in a country with the world’s newest name.Why do people love it?The landlocked country in south-eastern Africa may be small in size, but its scenery is diverse with both a cool mountainous region and a hot and dry lowland region. Progressive environmental laws have protected the landscapes, which remain a primary draw for new residents and visitors.“You can't help but admire the natural beauty of the country with its beautiful mountains and landscape. How green it is and its wildlife,” said Lindokuhle Mthupha who lives in the capital of Mbabane. “Our game reserves are always the first stop for most tourists.”eSwatini’s scenery is diverse, and the country has enacted progressive environmental laws to protect the landscape (Credit: Maurice Brand/Alamy)“I came to Swaziland for two weeks for a temporary job and never left,” said Ruth Buck who owns the Foresters Arms Hotel, 30km south-west of Mbabane, and is originally from South Africa. “I love driving along the country roads and enjoying the ever-c­hanging scenery, and the lively Swazi markets. It is such a beautiful country with a warm atmosphere, it was easy to stay.” Buck also felt welcomed by the people, whom she found to be friendly, humorous and generous.Robert Jupp, managing director of the Mantenga Lodge, who is originally from eSwatini, returned to the country after studying in South Africa. “I love the peace, the natural beauty, freedom, friendly people and climate,” he said, adding the small size makes it easy to navigate, and people are friendly and willing to help newcomers find their way.What is it like living here?It is such a beautiful country with a warm atmosphereThe country’s two major urban centres, Mbabane (the capital) and Manzini (the largest city), are still small by other countries’ standards (just 76,000 and 110,000 residents respectively), and the pace remains laid-back with people rarely in a rush. “We are always taking our time with everything... and I mean everything,” Mthupha said. “We are very leisurely and relaxed.”Most residents speak both English and siSwati, but residents appreciate the use of siSwati in greetings and goodbyes – and those friendly salutations remain an important part of the culture. “We still believe in greeting total strangers,” Mthupha said. “We are such a peace-loving, kind, humble and optimistic country. Anyone coming into the country can always attest to the fact that we are very humble and loving.”Mbabane, eSwatini’s capital city, is small compared to other countries’ standards, and the pace is laid-back (Credit: Thomas Cockrem/Alamy)Celebrating the country’s cultural heritage is also an important part of living here. “We have so many cultural ceremonies that have always attracted throngs of people, and that is where we truly celebrate being LiSwati [the name for the Swazi people]!” Mthupha said.The Reed Dance, held every September, begins with young women cutting large reeds to present to the Queen Mother of eSwatini, and then dressing in traditional attire for a large singing and dancing performance. The Incwala Festival, which takes place between December and January, marks the celebration of kingship and involves a days-long purification ritual, a large pageant with the king and military dressed in full regalia, and a huge fire where certain objects are burned to represent the passing of the old year.What else should you know?As one of the last absolute monarchies left in the world, eSwatini has struggled in recent years with significant wealth disparity between government officials (including King Mswati III) and citizens. The Golden Jubilee itself was very expensive, and showcased some of the dualities between celebrating the culture and frustration with the government.“There is an immense pride in Swazi culture and people seemed eager to share it [at the Golden Jubilee],” Elliott said. “But they were also eager to share their fury with a government that prioritises spending and personal wealth over the prosperity of the country.” The country forbids political opposition parties, and citizens can be punished for criticising the government or the king.Annual festivals like the Reed Dance celebrate eSwatini’s cultural heritage (Credit: EMANUELE STANO/Alamy)The country also struggles with the highest HIV/AIDS rate in the world, but has made great strides in the past decade at increasing access to antiretroviral treatment. Still, access to adequate healthcare can be limited in general, so many expats choose to venture to neighbouring South Africa for healthcare needs.  Despite the country’s economic struggles, the immense pride and dedication to social change is reflected in international events like the Bushfire Festival, where 26,000 people from around the world descend on Ezulwini, eSwatini’s ‘Valley of Heaven’, located between Mbabane and Manzini. Held annually in May, the festival hosts music acts as well as creative workshops and guest speakers. Many of the profits go to local charities like Young Heroes, which works directly with AIDS orphans.Get ready to fall totally in love with new people, a new culture and a new countryBefore and after the new name, the country is one where caring for others comes naturally. “We still have what we call ‘ubuntu’,” Mthupha said. The word translates to a feeling of common humanity toward others, and a recognition of living as part of a wider community. “It resonates with everyone. The energy and positive attitude is something for the books and you can't miss it when you are in the country,” she said.Her advice for new residents? “Get ready to fall totally in love with new people, a new culture and a new country. But most importantly, get ready to feel extremely and generously welcomed by strangers.”Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

MenuLoadingTravel JourneysFrom Africa to tea with the QueenShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: frans lemmens/Alamy)By Melissa Twigg19th July 2018Eighty-year-old Julia Albu drove through Africa, breezing her way through notorious borders and military blockades by saying she was going to London to have tea with the Queen.EEighty-year-old women are supposed to stay at home. The neatly dressed grandmother of our collective imagination derives her pleasure from indoor pursuits – cooking, reading, knitting. One thing octogenarian women aren’t supposed to do is embark on a solo five-month journey through Africa, driving from Cape Town to Cairo in a battered Toyota Conquest.Julia Albu never set out to be exceptional. Her daily routine slotted neatly into what the world expects from an older woman living in a leafy village near Cape Town. Every morning she would listen to the radio, and one day the discussion turned to then-President Jacob Zuma and his extravagant taste in cars.“I was incensed,” Albu said. “I phoned in immediately to say I was going to be 80, and my car, Tracy, was a 20-year-old Toyota and she ran beautifully. We could happily drive to London together, so why Zuma needed all these new cars was beyond me.”Eighty-year-old Julia Albu drove her 20-year-old Toyota Conquest from Cape Town to Cairo (Credit: Julia Albu)You may also be interested in:• The true ‘granddaddy’ of the Alps• What it means to know when to leave• The secret maps used in WWIIBuoyed by the enthusiastic response she received, Albu pledged on air to drive to Buckingham Palace to have tea with the Queen – and before long, the seeds of what had begun as a joke started germinating.“My partner had recently died, you see,” Albu said. “It was an exhausting process, and after all that I thought, ‘My goodness, there really isn’t much of life left’. I feel like I’m 36 from the shoulders up and 146 from the shoulders down, and I wanted the younger me to win for once.”I feel like I’m 36 from the shoulders up and 146 from the shoulders down, and I wanted the younger me to win for onceSix months later, on the dawn of her 80th birthday, Albu’s youthful half triumphed. With Tracy’s grey, squat exterior emblazoned with the rainbow-coloured stickers of her sponsors, Albu set off on a frosty morning from her house in Jakkalsfontein, hurtling up a gum tree-lined road pointing north.“I was raring to go,” she said. “I had been inoculated against every known virus, although the doctor said he didn't think I'd need any STD precautions, which was insulting. And Tracy was looking beautiful, upholstered from the seats to the sun visors in pink florals.”A cavalcade of Harley Davidsons bid her farewell outside Johannesburg, but other than that, South Africa passed in a blur of Karoo pepper trees and cold winter nights. And so it was left to Botswana to give Albu her first taste of African adventure.“We were pottering along the road when an elephant nearly came to blows with poor Tracy. And the potholes, oh they were too awful. But it all felt magical, from the heat drifting through my windows to the baobab trees. I knew I was going to be alright because everyone I met was so kind. They called me ‘Gogo’, which means grandmother.”The journey from South Africa to Egypt took Albu five months (Credit: frans lemmens/Alamy)In those early weeks, Albu often slept in a tent on the side of the road. But while her spirit was indomitable, her body was not, and sleeping on the ground soon took its toll. Her family rallied around to help – one daughter eventually drove with her to Zimbabwe, while her son accompanied her through Malawi.But interspersed with moments of hardship was Albu’s utter exhilaration at seeing the continent she was born in finally blossoming into focus. Her eyes lit up when she talked about the majesty of Lake Malawi or Zimbabwe’s Victoria Falls, but also when she described the details of life on the road. There was the man selling wicker furniture under a dusty Malawian tree, and the Zambian schoolgirls who read to her. She talked about vendors frying mice, truck drivers sharing food with her, and ripe tomatoes she plucked off the vine.Tracy is also an older lady just like me, and this was something we were doing together“I never felt lonely, even when I was alone,” she said. “I loved the times my children visited, and the intimate moments I spent with each of them. But you must remember Tracy is also an older lady just like me, and this was something we were doing together.”Albu’s age was clearly a mixed blessing. African border posts can be notoriously difficult to negotiate, but she breezed through most of them. The truck drivers she had been sharing the road with began to recognise her and ushered her to the front of the queue.“The belief in the wisdom of your elders is ingrained in a lot of African cultures – though often they just found me hilarious,” she said. “One Ugandan customs official asked why I was driving to London. ‘To have tea with the Queen’ I replied. His eyes were like marbles, and my passport was stamped in a jiffy.”Nonetheless, I sensed Albu’s profound frustration at being physically unable explore the nooks and crannies of the continent unfolding around her. “Oh to be 40 years younger and not in this godforsaken body,” she said. “The mountains I would have climbed; the lakes I would have swum in.”Albu was inspired to take the journey after listening to a radio show about former South African President Jacob Zuma’s extravagant taste in cars (Credit: Julia Albu)Instead, Albu quenched her boundless thirst for Africa through its people. Her travel diary is filled with page upon page of names, numbers and business cards, including the addresses of hundreds of teachers she sent schoolbooks to through a charity she is affiliated with.In Tanzania, she stumbled upon a small village and began talking to one of the elders, named William. They spent hours together that day and the next, sitting on a bench while putting the world to rights. Months later, a letter from him plopped through her door in Cape Town. “Your radiant and full-of-life personality is amazing,” he wrote. “Your willingness to share the good moments of others taught me what life can mean. I, in my own way, promise to give you company.”During the trip, Albu learned to shake off age with a flick of her hair. In Tanzania, at a honeymooner resort, she peeled off her dress for a midnight swim. In Ethiopia, she camped with eager 20-somethings in the Danakil Depression, a neon-hued moonscape of lava and salt plains that is often described as the ‘gateway to hell’.Her enthusiasm for Ethiopia is particularly infectious – for the dramatic landscapes and for the profound spirituality that imbues the place. Sudan, too, she describes with a sense of awe that I suspect is reserved for an Africa with which she no longer feels familiar.“I think I got my moment of purest joy when I was driving alone through the Sudanese desert on the long road to Khartoum,” she said. “My tape of hymns was playing at full blast and I was singing ‘Jerusalem’, thinking about England’s green and pleasant land while a shepherd shuffled through the sand in the distance.”Albu says she got her first taste of African adventure in Botswana when an elephant nearly came to blows with her car (Credit: Richard Bradley/Alamy)Albu’s African odyssey ended in Egypt, the country where her luck in namedropping the Queen finally ran out. Held at border control for several days while Tracy was fitted with Arabic number plates, her only option was to sleep in a cafe. “I’m not sure if you’ve ever spent the night alone in a room with seven Egyptian men, but it certainly was an experience,” she said. “They were kind though, and if they were surprised I was a woman on my own, they didn’t show it.”The world has changed, and I’m jolly glad it hasBecause it is not just Albu’s age that has captured our imagination, it is also her gender. Women today fight for political, economic and sexual equality, but the decision to drive alone through Africa is one that would raise eyebrows in even the most tolerant of societies.“But why should men be the only ones who are allowed to go off and have big adventures on their own?” Albu asked. “I was never afraid for my life on that trip. Yes, when I was a girl the thought of me driving alone through Africa would have been utterly absurd – but the world has changed, and I’m jolly glad it has.”Up through Egypt she went, stopping off in Aswan and The Valley of the Kings and finishing in the polluted streets of Cairo. On her last day, she parked on the banks of the Nile to collect some murky river water, which was destined to sit on her mantelpiece next to bottles filled up at the source of the White Nile in Tanzania and the Blue Nile in Ethiopia.Albu’s children joined her for parts of her journey, but most of the time she drove alone (Credit: Julia Albu)From Cairo, Albu flew back to Cape Town, watching the continent unfold below her and pitying her fellow passengers for their sky-high perspective. After recuperating in Jakkalsfontein for a few months, Albu boarded a plane to Europe and was reunited with Tracy – who had languished for weeks in a container in Greece after crossing the Mediterranean by ferry. From Greece, she drove through Albania, Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Germany and Holland, and arrived in London for the summer season.“Oh, I was dying to have tea with the Queen – particularly after telling the world and his wife that I was going to,” Albu says. “But it was the week of Royal Ascot and apparently she was otherwise engaged. The English are a strange breed – I’m not sure they appreciated quite how long my journey to Buckingham Palace was.”What do you want me to do, sit on this sofa and wait to die?Although astoundingly, London was not the final stop in Albu’s odyssey. Last week, she crossed the Channel again and is currently heading for the heel of Italy, from where she will sail for Tunisia and begin her drive to Cape Town – crossing Africa overland for the second time in as many years.“Well, why not? What do you want me to do, sit on this sofa and wait to die?” she asks, with a laugh. “There is a freedom that comes with old age that so many people don’t realise. I didn’t know it before my adventure, but at my age you’re actually freer than you’ve ever been – you lose a husband and the children are grown, and you worry less about the consequences of everything.”Albu: “I didn’t know it before my adventure, but at my age you’re actually freer than you’ve ever been” (Credit: Julia Albu)We have a tendency to treat older people with kid gloves, but excitement and adventure are not prerogatives of the young. And if the inhabitants of Buckingham Palace one day read about Albu’s story and send an embossed invitation down to South Africa, she and Queen will undoubtedly have a lot to say on the subject.Travel Journeys is a BBC Travel series exploring travellers’ inner journeys of transformation and growth as they experience the world.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

MenuLoadingAdventure & ExperienceThe Djibouti lake posing as paradiseShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Peter Watson)By Peter Watson12th July 2018From a distance, Lac Assal may look like tropical waters fringed with powdery white sand. Up close, it’s an inhospitable alien landscape.At first glance, Djibouti’s Lac Assal could easily be mistaken for a Caribbean beachAt first glance, Djibouti’s Lac Assal appears as a glorious expanse of aquamarine water ringed by blinding white sand. It could easily be mistaken for a Caribbean beach. However, it is all a façade, a mere simulacrum of paradise. The vast plain is not sand at all, but salt. 

Walking barefoot towards the water across the crystallised salt field is uncomfortable at best. As you near the lake’s edge, the fierce wind whips across the plain and slings salt particles against your skin. Entering the water offers no respite. The warm, shallow lake has a strange, viscous quality; an oily texture that leaves a film on the skin. It stings the eyes and bites on every contact. A tiny paper cut becomes utter torment.

The film of salt, tolerable in the water, becomes itchy when scorched dry in the sun. The debris bristles on the skin and leaves you itching like a flea-ridden dog. This is no Caribbean beach. (Credit: Peter Watson)Lac Assal is the lowest point in Africa and the third lowest point in the worldAt 155m below sea level, Lac Assal is the lowest point in Africa and the third lowest point in the world after the Dead Sea (-423m) and the Sea of Galilee (-214m). It is fed by seawater via 5km-long subsurface geothermal springs linked to the Gulf of Tadjoura, an extension of the Gulf of Aden to the south-east of Lac Assal. There are no natural outflow points in the lake, meaning the lake water is trapped in the crater under Djibouti’s searing sun. 

Thanks to high rates of evaporation, Lac Assal has an average salt concentration of 34.8% (which climbs to as much as 40% at a depth of 20m), around 10 times saltier than seawater. It is the second saltiest body of water on Earth after Don Juan Pond in Antarctica, which has a salinity level of more than 47%. The Dead Sea has an average salt concentration of 33.7%. (Credit: Peter Watson)Lac Assal is situated on a geological depression known as the Afar Triple JunctionLac Assal is situated on a geological depression known as the Afar Triple Junction, where three of Earth’s tectonic plates are pulling apart, causing some unusual, often surreal, natural phenomena. The African, Somalian and Arabian plates meet in the depression, which stretches across the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar Region of Ethiopia. The depression is home to an array of ecological anomalies, including the Dallol sulphur pools and Erta Ale volcano in [Ethiopia’s Danakil Desert](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160913-inside-ethiopias-sizzling-cauldron).

Encircled by dormant volcanoes, Lac Assal – like so much of the surrounding landscape – feels like it could be on a different planet. As the water evaporates, salt and other mineral deposits cling to one another, creating jagged pillars and other formations that make up this otherworldly landscape. (Credit: Peter Watson)Trains of camels and donkeys can still be seen carrying up to 120kg of salt eachDespite the inhospitable landscape, the Afar and Issa people have long lived and worked in the area, with salt fuelling bountiful trade for centuries. Members of the communities scrape and dig the salt from the lake’s shore to be transported along ancient caravan routes to Ethiopia in exchange for coal, coffee and other commodities. Historically, ivory and even slaves were traded for Lac Assal salt. 

Trains of camels and donkeys can still be seen carrying up to 120kg of salt each to Berhale in Ethiopia, a journey that can take up to five weeks. There, the salt is unloaded and taken by truck to Ethiopia’s larger cities for wider distribution. (Credit: Peter Watson)The salt from Lac Assal became known as ‘white gold’When the [Eritrean-Ethiopian War](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44004212) broke out in 1998, Djibouti replaced Eritrea as Ethiopia’s primary salt supplier. The demands of Ethiopia’s population (around 62 million at the time) kept prices high. Thus, the salt from Lac Assal became known as ‘white gold’.

Traditionally, the majority of Lac Assal’s salt extraction took place on shore by hand. However, with higher demand came the need for faster and more modern extraction processes. Heavier machinery was used to extract much larger pans of salt from the water instead, where it is softer and easier to mine. Salt production in Lac Assal rocketed from thousands to hundreds of thousands of tonnes per year, leading Djibouti’s government to expand the extraction process, further utilising modern methods in order to export the salt all around the world. (Credit: Peter Watson)Ancient and modern methods of harvesting salt occur in tandem at Lac AssalToday, ancient and modern methods of harvesting salt occur in tandem. While camel caravans can still be seen crossing the landscape, a surfaced road now leads 115km east from the lake to Djibouti City where millions of tonnes of Lac Assal’s salt are shipped abroad every year. 

The proposed [Lake Assal Salt Project](https://www3.opic.gov/environment/eia/lakeassal/Lake_Assal_Salt_Project_EMP_Report_Nov08.pdf) and a new Chinese-funded industrial plant are poised to further commodify the lake. The projects will develop a much larger salt storage and shipping site nearer to the lake, so Djibouti’s ‘white gold’ can be exported directly from the area instead of through the port in the capital. (Credit: Peter Watson)Lac Assal’s high salinity has proven health benefitsThe lake may be a harsh environment for flora and fauna – precious few microorganisms can survive in it – but much like the Dead Sea, Lac Assal’s high salinity has proven health benefits. Rich in minerals like magnesium, calcium and sulphates, Lac Assal’s waters can be used to cleanse, soothe and revitalise the skin, as well as treat ailments like muscle pain and rheumatoid arthritis. (Credit: Peter Watson)In 2015, Djibouti nominated Lac Assal for Unesco World Heritage statusLac Assal’s future is surely one of commerce, whether in salt extraction or increased tourism. In 2015, Djibouti nominated Lac Assal for [Unesco World Heritage status]( https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5959/), and along with the new industrial plant, there are proposals to build a visitor centre and develop wellness resorts similar to those found on the coast of the Dead Sea in Israel and Jordan. 

Where the local communities and their traditional methods of salt mining fit into this brave new world remains to be seen. As has occurred in many places around the world, the modernisation of mining and traditional industries can often lead to loss of livelihood. One would hope the development of tourism in the area would open up new opportunities; however, the transition will not be without its difficulties and could take generations to realise.

MenuLoadingCulture & IdentityPico Iyer on the secret of immersive travelShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: mantaphoto/Getty Images)By Pico Iyer11th June 2020The celebrated writer reflects on how this once-in-a-lifetime experiment of global stillness can teach us to see the world with new eyes.II walked off a cruise ship this January, having sailed for 10 days around the Antarctic Peninsula, in a rare state of exaltation. I’d wandered among a huge colony of penguins before, in Patagonia, but nothing had prepared me for standing, day after day, surrounded by the irresistible birds as they waddled past, threw back their heads to squawk, or glided, with surpassing grace, through the icy water.The deepest reason why I was moved, I came to realise, was that I spent so much of each day sitting stillI’d seen calving glaciers in Alaska, but that somehow paled next to the sensation of drifting in a 10-person Zodiac for one midsummer morning across a sea of turquoise and aqua and silver icebergs. Even the time I’d watched my mother swim with dolphins in Tahiti, 20 years ago, was nothing next to the sight of 50 orcas porpoising beside our ship in bright light, long after dinnertime.By freeing himself of other people and quietly watching the world around him, the author felt a deep sense of liberation and clarity (Credit: Ray Hems/Getty Images)What was it that had transported me so profoundly, I wondered? Of course, there’s a special clarity in sailing through a noiseless world where there’s often no sign of human habitation. And nearly all my fellow passengers seemed as liberated as I by the fact that phone calls were almost impossible on the ship and the internet punitively slow. Every morning, a four-page digest of news told us of a virus in faraway Wuhan, but that barely translated to this unpeopled landscape with its 360-degree horizons. Yet the deepest reason why I was moved, I came to realise, was that I spent so much of each day sitting still.Destinations can only be as rich as what we bring to themIt’s a relationship that has come to haunt me more and more over 46 years of travel: my capacity to be stirred is in direct proportion to my ability to be quiet. That’s one reason why, whenever I visit Midtown Manhattan, I reflexively seek out St Patrick’s Cathedral to inhale, in silence, everything I’ve just experienced and to prepare myself for the honking horns and noisy meetings to come. It’s also the reason so many of us try to sit on a rock in Petra before the tour buses arrive, or walk along the treeless emptiness of Iceland at 02:00 in mid-June when the sun is just beginning to sit on top of the sea.We’re most transported when we’re least distracted. And we’re most at peace – ready to be transformed, in fact – when most deeply absorbed. I’d much rather converse with one sight for 60 minutes than 60 places for one minute each. When I travel with the Dalai Lama – as I’ve done for 10 recent Novembers across Japan – I’m convinced that the wide-awake responsiveness he brings to every last convenience store and passing toddler is partly the result of the three hours he spends at the beginning of every day in meditation. Destinations can only be as rich as what we bring to them.A traveller's capacity to be stirred is often in direct proportion to their ability to quietly contemplate the world around them (Credit: mantaphoto/Getty Images)During this new season of the virus, I’ve been spending many happy hours on the tiny sunlit terrace outside my apartment in Nara, Japan, with the poet laureate of lockdowns, Marcel Proust. I think of him also as the patron saint of travellers, precisely because he was confined by severe asthma to spending three years alone in his cork-lined bedroom. What allowed him to read with such acuity the small print of every crowded soiree? To recall with such fresh immediacy a long-ago gaggle of young beauties on a beach? To record with wakeful precision the sight of a loved one asleep? That time in solitary, I suspect. It was Proust, I never forget, who reminded us that the point of every trip is not new sights but new eyes. Once we have those, even the old sights are reborn.The point of every trip is not new sights but new eyesI think, too, of the preternatural vividness of Emily Dickinson. Not leaving her house for 26 years brought her to such a high pitch of attention that she could see South Pole and North – and wild nights and heaven and carriage-rides with death – just by standing at her window. It was through going nowhere that she made everywhere seem wondrous.You may also be interested in:• When everything falls away• The travel 'ache' you can't translate• A wartime solution to isolationI got my own first taste of the richness and stimulation of sitting still on one of my greatest adventures, 29 years ago, when I drove to a Catholic hermitage three and a half hours from my parents’ home in California. I stepped, on arrival, into a room consisting of a single bed, a long desk, a chest of drawers and windows looking out on a private walled garden and the still, blue plate of the Pacific Ocean, extending in every direction, 1200ft below. In the absence of disturbances – no television, no telephone reception, no internet connection – every tolling bell seemed momentous. I noticed every Steller’s jay as I never did when they alighted outside my room in my family home. Nothing I’d seen in Bhutan or Ushuaia had carried me so far or deep. I’m not a Christian but I realised that silence is non-denominational.From Proust to Dickinson, many great travellers have found that prolonged periods of isolation have helped them see the world in vivid detail (Credit: fizkes/Getty Images)Three days later, of course, I was back in my all-over-the-place, multitasking, split-screen life. But those three days in silence opened a door to possibility, to the point where, by now, I’ve returned to stay in that hermitage more than 90 times, on occasion for as long as three weeks.No-one has yet mastered the art of seeing the world deeply while running aroundMore than that, it’s thrown a fresh light on all my other travels. Returning to Myanmar four years ago, I simply took myself every morning, before breakfast, to the Shwedagon Pagoda: there was no need to go anywhere else, since young lovers, schoolkids, nuns, family historians – the entire city – seemed to be walking past me. Every time I visit San Francisco now, even on business, I try to take a long walk soon after I wake up, and not to go online for as long as possible. I’d rather see the world around me than be back amidst presidential tweets or messages from my bosses.I think back to the teenager who bumped by bus from San Diego to Bolivia in 1975. At that time, I was so excited by new stamps in my passport and the prospect of telling my friends I’d crossed a pass at 15,000ft and stayed (inadvertently) for three nights in a house of ill repute that I measured my days by the quantity of experiences they threw up. It took years of travel to appreciate how a single morning in Kyoto, wide-awake in a quiet garden, could transform me more than any packed three-week itinerary across Asia.By making the most of our enforced stillness now, we may all become better, more thoughtful travellers later (Credit: manjik/Getty Images)Many of us now are waiting to emerge from long weeks of enforced stillness and to think about what travel can be in the future. In my case, discouraged from taking buses or trains, my wife and I enjoy walks every day around our neighbourhood and have discovered a bamboo forest, lined with flowering cherry trees, only five minutes from the apartment where we’ve been living for 27 years. Staying inside has helped me notice the light, the song of nightingales, even an occasionally passing motorbike as never before.I’ve also got to hear from my too-seldom encountered best friend, reporting that he’s on his way to Antarctica next February. How should he prepare, he asked? I told him to read Admiral Byrd’s book, Alone, about all that the famous explorer discovered while trapped inside a tiny space near the South Pole, alone, for five months. I also told him to make the most of his stillness in advance.

MenuLoadingAdventure & Experience | Remote PlacesA world isolated from life by 1,400kmShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Shafik Meghji)By Shafik Meghji1st April 2019A rugged land of glaciers, mountains and fjords, South Georgia is one of the remotest places on Earth.“Stay at least 200m away from the whaling station – it’s filled with asbestos and the roofs could literally blow off,” warned expedition leader Nate Small, as we stepped gingerly out of our Zodiac and into the fizzing surf at Stromness Bay, South Georgia. I picked a careful route across the grey-pebble beach, eyeing warily the growling fur seals and slumbering elephant seals, their gargantuan bodies emitting a series of burps, bellows and rumbling bass notes.At the far end of the bay, set against a mountain slope and surrounded by bog land, was a cluster of dilapidated, rusty, corrugated iron buildings. Huge sections of the roofs and walls were missing, and those that remained rattled incessantly in the near gale-force wind. It looked as if a natural disaster had struck. I stopped at an ‘Asbestos – Keep Out’ sign and peered through the encroaching mist, my extremities numb from the sub-zero conditions. It was a struggle to picture the station as a thriving community, yet a century ago Stromness was part of a highly profitable – and brutal – industry that transformed South Georgia into the whaling capital of the South Atlantic.Stromness, South Georgia, was once part of a highly profitable – and brutal – industry (Credit: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy)You may also be interested in:• The city that lit the world• A strange life at the end of the world• Is this the world’s last paradise?Earlier in my trip, Seb Coulthard, expedition guide and on-board historian for Polar Latitudes, told me how Ernest Shackleton arrived in Stromness in 1916 following his epic 1,300km escape from Elephant Island, one of the South Shetland Islands that lie just north of the Antarctic Peninsula, after his ship was trapped and later crushed by pack ice. For the polar explorer, the whaling station represented civilisation, but today nature is slowly reclaiming it. Fur seals sheltered beside a blubber cooker, king penguins waddled past disintegrating warehouses and skuas (aggressive, dark-brown seabirds) washed themselves in meandering streams that once ran with the blood of tens of thousands of whales.A rugged, inhospitable land of glaciers, mountains and fjords, South Georgia is one of the most remote places on Earth. This sub-Antarctic British overseas territory in the South Atlantic is around 1,400km from its nearest inhabited neighbour, the Falkland Islands, and is only accessible by sea. Like me, the majority of the nearly 18,000 people who visit each year are on Antarctic cruises. The island spans 3,755 sq km – less than a fifth of the size of Wales – and around half is covered permanently by ice (though, as a result of climate change, its glaciers are drastically retreating). Despite its isolation and harsh environment, South Georgia was once a vital part of the global economy. First sighted in 1675, this uninhabited island was claimed for Great Britain by James Cook in 1775. His accounts of abundant seal populations aroused the interest of sealers from the UK and the US. In little more than a century, South Georgia’s fur seals were hunted to the verge of extinction. By the early 1900s, sealing was no longer economically viable, but it was quickly replaced by an equally bloody industry.South Georgia was once a vital part of the global economy, but today it’s being reclaimed by nature (Credit: Shafik Meghji)The day after my visit to Stromness, my ship sailed south through 75-knot winds to King Edward Cove. Scattered with shipwrecks and mini icebergs, backed by forbidding mountains and obscured by drizzle, this sweeping bay was the location of South Georgia’s first whaling station, Grytviken. Today it is the site of the island’s main settlement, home to the majority of the 15 to 30 people, mostly scientists and government officials, who live on South Georgia at any one time.After paying my respects to Shackleton, who is buried in Grytviken’s small cemetery, I was taken around the decaying whaling station by Finlay Raffle, a curator at the site’s museum. We walked through an industrial landscape of squat towers, warehouses, power plants, mazes of inter-connected pipes, and huge blubber and bone cookers, everything thickly covered with rust. Along the shoreline, ships and boats in varying stages of collapse were pushed up at odd angles by the tide. Chunks of whale bone carpeted the muddy ground.In 1902, Norwegian polar explorer Carl Anton Larsen stopped in South Georgia and chanced upon a beautiful natural harbour. After the discovery of several sealers’ try-pots – used to render oil from blubber – the area was named Grytviken (‘Pot Cove’ in Norwegian). “They moored not far off from where your ship is today,” Raffle said. “The only difference was when they looked out over the water they saw hundreds of whales in this bay alone.” With the northern hemisphere whaling industry in decline due to the decimation of whale populations, Larsen spotted a business opportunity. He returned to Grytviken in November 1904 and set up a whaling station, which swiftly prospered. By 1912, there were six other whaling stations on South Georgia, including Stromness.Grytviken, South Georgia’s first whaling station, is the site of the island’s main settlement (Credit: Shafik Meghji)Narrowly dodging a pair of fur seals, who blended in remarkably well with the rusty machinery, we approached an old whale-catcher. With its steam-powered engine, reinforced hull and mighty harpoon gun, the whaling ship Petrel could capture as many as 14 whales on a single trip. Back at Grytviken, the animals would be winched onto a slipway, the ‘flensing plan’. “It was very slippery with all the blood and oil, so the men wore boots with nails in them to grip properly” Raffle said. “They had a flensing knife – a long, almost hockey stick with a sharp, curved blade, which they used to cut the blubber away.” The whole process took 20 minutes per whale.Initially the whalers were only interested in the blubber, but later regulations forced them to use the whole of the carcass, Raffle explained, pointing out gory rotating blades and a 24-tonne blubber cooker. Although the meat and bone-meal were sold as animal feed and fertiliser, whale oil was the real prize. “The best oils went into food products like margarine and ice cream,” he said. “The second grade went into soap and cosmetics, and the worst was used in industrial processes.” Whale oil also provided glycerol, used in the manufacture of explosives, and high-quality lubricants for rifles, chronometers and other military equipment. As a result, demand soared during World War One and Two.There were 450 men at Grytviken in its heyday, working 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, in temperatures that could plunge below -10C. Larsen was keen to look after their spiritual needs, building an impressive neo-Gothic church. But, said Raffle said, the pastor “was the least employed man on the station”. The cinema, windswept football pitch and ski jump – now just a few bits of broken timber protruding from a hillside – proved rather more popular. The community store, or ‘slop chest’, also provided distractions. “Tobacco was the most popular item but the men also bought lots of cologne,” Raffle said. “Larsen didn’t allow alcohol, so they drank cologne instead. They also had illicit stills, and even got boot polish, squeezed it through bread, and drank the drippings, which apparently also had alcohol. Anything to pass the time.”The whaling ship Petrel could capture as many as 14 whales on a single trip (Credit: David Tipling Photo Library/Alamy)Raffle left me at the former manager’s house, a simple, white-washed building that has been turned into the site’s museum. The displays inside contain some stark figures: 175,250 whales were processed on South Georgia between 1904 and 1965, when the industry collapsed due to over-hunting and developments in the petrochemicals industry. If you consider the Antarctic region as a whole and include the many ‘factory ships’ that processed whales on board, almost 1.5 million whales were killed between 1904 and 1978, when hunting of the species eventually ended.Whale populations haven’t recovered. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) says blue whale numbers in the southern hemisphere have fallen from as many as 200,000 to the ‘low thousands’; fin whales have undergone a similar decline. There are an estimated 60,000 humpbacks in the southern hemisphere, but this is also far lower than the pre-whaling era. In September 2018, IWC plans for a South Atlantic whaling sanctuary were rejected by pro-whaling countries. Japan later announced it will resume commercial whaling for the first time in three decades, prompting global outrage.It’s a bittersweet irony in that it was a terrible, brutal industry, yet nature took its sweet revenge by reclaiming itThe plight of the whales is undeniably bleak, but in other respects, South Georgia has become an improbable model of conservation. One of the world’s largest marine reserves, the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area, was created here in 2012 to protect more than one million sq km of the surrounding waters, while seal numbers have bounced back: the island now has 98% of the world’s Antarctic fur seals and roughly 50% of its elephant seals.South Georgia also has 30 million breeding pairs of seabirds. During my visit, I spent a morning at St Andrews Bay in the company of 400,000 king penguins – one of four penguin species found on the island – and an afternoon on Prion Island, an important breeding site for wandering albatrosses. Last year, South Georgia was declared rodent-free after a pioneering eradication programme, which the authorities hope will allow birds like the endemic South Georgia pipit and South Georgia pintail to flourish.South Georgia is now home to large populations of fur and elephant seals and around 400,000 king penguins (Credit: Shafik Meghji)Despite the profusion of wildlife, it was the island’s whaling heritage that remained foremost in my mind as I sailed out of Grytviken. “When you walk about these stations all you see are these rusting boilers, blubber cookers and bone saws,” Coulthard said. “It’s a bittersweet irony in that it was a terrible, brutal industry, yet nature took its sweet revenge by reclaiming it. It’s a reminder that nature doesn’t need human beings; we need nature.”This trip was made possible by Polar Latitudes.

MenuLoadingYou’re either an explorer, or you’re not. Which one are you?Share using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Jean-Pierre Clatot/Getty)By Erin Block27th October 2015Find out why you might be sitting in your office chair, instead of making your first attempt at the South Pole.AAntarctica is unbearable in July. It is so treacherous that in 1911, explorers Apsley Cherry-Garrard, Bill Wilson and Henry Bowers returned to base camp with shattered teeth and fingernails that hung by invisible threads. Reports of their journey told of clothing that was forcibly cut from their bodies, as the line between fabric and skin melted many miles before.The three men travelled to Cape Crozier to collect samples of Emperor Penguin eggs and help uncover the evolutionary link between reptiles and birds. For 35 days, they travelled 70 miles in arctic winds and temperatures that fell below -60C. They marched to their probable deaths.Now here’s the crazy part: all three tortured men went back.But why did they? What is it about exploration that prompts people to take gigantic risks? Why do some of us jump into the fear of the unknown – even when death is at stake – while others of us only dream? Why are we sitting in our office chairs instead of making our first attempts at the South Pole?Biking through the Australian desert (Credit: Ezra Shaw/Getty)“I love the freedom,” said Roff Smith, a National Geographic photographer, contributor and expeditions leader. “It comes as a puzzling surprise to me when someone says they are not curious about what’s beyond the next bend.”Smith actively looks for places that represent the edge of the world. One of his most memorable journeys was a nine-month, 16,000km bike trip around the Australian outback.It simply didn’t occur to me that I might quit.“It was a funny thing. Later, when I was describing some of the difficulties in riding through the Kimberley, the Great Sandy Desert and the Nullarbor Plain, somebody said they bet I must have thought all the time about quitting,” Smith said. “But you know what? It never even occurred to me. Not once. The thought never crossed my mind. Not because I was being heroic – it simply didn’t occur to me that I might quit.”The rugged Australian outback inspires exploration (Credit: Sara Winter/iStock)Are you a risk taker?Georgetown University associate professor and neuroscientist John W Vanmeter studies risk for a living and has a good idea of why people like Smith never think about quitting. There are two regions of the brain that promote and counteract risky behaviour. The limbic system is driven by novelty and is particularly sensitive to reward from positive and negative stimuli. The prefrontal cortex, on the other hand, makes executive decisions and puts the break on potentially risky decisions. Those who are driven to explore, Vanmeter explained, may have more activity in the limbic system.“One person’s brain may be more or less developed,” Vanmeter said. “The connections between these brain regions may be more finely tuned in one individual than another.”Some brains are hardwired to take risks and explore (Credit: Sandra Behne/Getty)Smith is not alone in feeling rewarded by exploration. Many adventurers get a sense of achievement from knowing that they conquered their fears or went the distance when others believed they couldn’t. Borge Ousland, a Norwegian polar explorer who’s in the process of conquering the world’s 20 greatest icecaps, believes that adventure helps him feel more connected.When I’m on trips, I am much more present in my own life.“When I’m on trips, I am much more present in my own life… because I have to focus on the here and now,” Ousland said. “Back home, I am always focusing on something happening in the future. [On expeditions], time stops, and you become like a Stone Age man, acting on instincts and knowing you are a part of the universe. That’s one of the most valuable feelings I have had.”Views of Norway that can only seen by pushing the boundaries of travel (Credit: Dominique Faget/Getty)Do you thrive on positive reinforcement? The positive reinforcement that follows this sense of achievement is fuelled by dopamine, which causes a natural high and creates a state of euphoria. And according to Paul Phillips, associate professor of psychology and pharmacology at the University of Washington, the greater the pay off, the higher the surge of dopamine. There is a direct correlation between high levels of dopamine and risk taking behaviour.We all have different levels of dopamine in our systems, and other impulses – like the need for safety and security – affect the way we respond to positive reinforcement. As such, your normal levels of dopamine will dictate your natural choice to stay close to home or want to explore.But you don’t have to bike across the Australian outback or face the harsh landscapes of Antarctica to be an explorer. For some people, the drive can be satisfied from simply dropping into a new place and pushing the limits of what they know.Andrew Evans joins a drum circle in remote southeastern Malawi (Credit: Andrew Evans)Take Andrew Evans, travel writer, digital nomad and TV host. He never had a desire to bungee jump or push the limits of his own body. Instead, he chooses to go outside his comfort zone psychologically. Evans simply loves the thrill of being in an unknown place.I feel as if it’s human nature to go beyond the horizon.“I grew up in Ohio. Safe and predictable. For me, not knowing where I’m going to sleep that night is incredibly exciting,” Evans said. “I feel as if it’s human nature to go beyond the horizon. Once we understand one horizon we keep walking to the next and then to the next.”Do you push beyond your comfort zone?This idea of pushing boundaries goes back to our ancestors and our basic foraging patterns, which Phillips referred to as the “Exploit vs Explore” theory. In the beginnings of our ancestors’ evolution, if a human was looking for food and found one abundant area, he could either decide to stay and exploit one patch of food, or push on to find greener pastures.“This program in the brain is specific to each individual’s brain,” Phillips said. “It is central to why we go out and explore the world.” Those who push on believe there is more to be gained by leaving what’s known; they believe the risk is worth the reward.Tristan Da Cunha can exclusively be reached by boat (Credit: Brian Gratwicke/Flickr/CC-BY-2.0)Recently, Evans travelled to Tristan Da Cunha, a volcanic island of about 300 people. It’s the most remote society on the planet. You can’t reach this British Territory by a commercial ship or plane. It takes five to seven days to get there; and once you arrive, the town council decides whether you stay. It’s a long journey to risk the possibility of immediately having to return home – but the reward, for Evans, was worth it.“It’s a powerful feeling to stare out at the blue ocean and know that the entire world is almost intangible” Evans recalled.The question of why we explore will continue to be one that explorers and scientists try to answer. It’s human nature to push forward and be curious, but our brains also play a big role in the risks we do and do not take. Whether beginning your first trek through the Pacific Coast Highway in California or free climbing in Switzerland – you’re either hardwired to explore or you’re not. Which one are you?No matter the type of explorer, these adventurous destinations will push your limits and fuel a desire to step into the unknown.Tristan Da Cunha, the most remote society on Earth, is a long way from home (Credit: Brian Gratwicke/Flickr/CC-BY-2.0)(Credit: Brian Gratwicke/Flickr/CC-BY-2.0)Andrew Evans confronts king penguins in South Georgia (Credit: Andrew Evans)(Credit: Andrew Evans)In Australia, Roff Smith says the craggy Bungle Bungles in the Kimberley are a must-see (Credit: Australian Scenics/Getty)(Credit: Australian Scenics/Getty)It took two years for Borge Ousland to get permission to visit Russia's Franz Joseph Land (Credit: Daisy Gilardini/Getty)(Credit: Daisy Gilardini/Getty)At the ""edge of the world"", Gardiner Point in Tasmania, the ocean extends to Argentina (Credit: Christopher Neugebauer/Flickr/CC-BY-SA-2.0)(Credit: Christopher Neugebauer/Flickr/CC-BY-SA-2.0)North Cape in Norway is the 'top of the world' (Credit: David Völgyes/Flickr/CC-BY-SA-2.0)(Credit: David Völgyes/Flickr/CC-BY-SA-2.0)Tierra Del Fuego in Argentina, the last livable place before Antarctica (Credit: AFP/Getty)(Credit: AFP/Getty)Ascending Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador brings you closest to the Earth's atmosphere (Credit: Daniele Pellegrini/Getty)(Credit: Daniele Pellegrini/Getty)Share using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinShareAround the BBC

MenuLoadingCamp with penguins in AntarcticaShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinBy Lindsey Galloway24th September 2013A few hundred travellers each year can experience the inner part of the icy continent with (almost) all the comforts of home.WWith its
constant sub-zero temperatures and uninhabited glacier terrain, Antarctica is
not usually thought of as a luxury locale. But tour operator White Desert is determined to change
that. Offering a few expeditions a year to their upscale, well-furnished camp,
the group affords a few hundred travellers the chance to experience the inner
part of the icy continent with (almost) all the comforts of home.White
Desert founder Patrick Woodhead, who led the very first east-to-west traverse
of Antarctica in 2002, envisioned the camp on one of his many expeditions.
While waiting out a storm in the bitter cold, he and his fellow travellers imagined
a more inclusive polar experience complete with luxury transportation and
accommodation.  
Today
travellers get to experience that dream when they book one of the bespoke
itineraries or organised trips that are offered during the continent’s late
spring and summer (November and December). The trips all start with a five-hour
private flight from Cape Town to an ice runway perched atop a 50m-tall frozen waterfall
located within the Dronning Maud Land region in eastern Antarctica. 
Guests then
get cosy at the eco-friendly Whichaway
camp, which is completely solar- and wind-powered. The tented refuge includes
a living area furnished with a central warming stove, fur rugs, a library and
maps of the South Pole in tribute to early Victorian explorers. Six sleeping
pods are made of fibreglass panels that resist Antarctica’s notoriously strong
winds and keep the interior quiet and warm. The pods – measuring 6m in diameter
– include a double bed, a writing desk and a private bathroom. 
Meals are
also served in style, prepared by a professional South African chef. A full
English breakfast is followed by a light lunch, with all the stops pulled out
for a three-course dinner, which might include barbequed steak, salmon served
with wasabi and plenty of Champagne. 
While at
the camp, guests can participate in a variety of activities, including exploring
ice caves, visiting a nearby science base, kite-skiing or touring a colony of Emperor
penguins, where more than 6,000 of the flightless birds nest and raise their
chicks. 
As part of
its commitment to have zero environmental impact, the entire camp is dismantled
at the end of each season, leaving behind no trace of human touch among the
vast glacier landscape.
PracticalitiesBook online
at white-desert.com.
The eight- to 10-day tours only accommodate 12 people, so spots fill up
quickly. Per person cost ranges from 18,000 euros to 57,000 euros depending on
the length of the tour and the activities involved. Guests must provide their
own polar-ready clothing, though White Desert does offer items for purchase
before the trip. Antarctica White DesertGuests can participate in a variety of activities, including touring a colony of penguins.

MenuLoadingAntarctica’s land of fire and iceShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinBy Shaney Hudson19th August 2013In one of the coldest places on Earth, the still-active volcano of Deception Island has a dangerous whaling past.Deception Island, AntarcticaDeception Island is one of Antarctica’s biggest surprises. Part of the South Shetland group, the island appears on the map as a broken ring or a “C” shape. But it is actually the collapsed, sunken cone of a still-active volcano.
 
Along the shore, the island steams as cold Antarctic water meets the black volcanic sand, warmed by geothermal activity. If you dip your hand in the coastal waters, the temperature is that of a luke-warm bath. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaShips enter Deception Island by passing through Neptune’s Bellows (pictured), a narrow opening in the caldera. Just 230m wide, the hazardous passage is further complicated by a large rock, known as Ravn Rock, which lies just 2.5m below the surface. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaDeception Island was once used as a base for sealers, but that practice gave way to the more profitable whaling industry at the turn of the 20th Century. Once hunted to near extinction for their pelts, today fur seals are abundant in the sub-Antarctic islands. Pictured here, an Antarctic fur seal rests beneath a decaying whaling structure. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaLocated just inside the entrance of the caldera, Whaler’s Bay was used as a whaling site from 1906 until 1931, and a shore station was established in 1912. Run by a Norwegian whaling company, the New Sandefjord station was set up to process and extract oil from the whale carcasses, which was used in lamps and to make soap. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaToday, boilers and tanks that once stored the whale oil until it could be transported north at the end of the season stand abandoned along the volcanic shoreline. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaDebris, such as wooden ships and scattered wood, lie broken and discarded along the shore, bleached grey from the extreme conditions. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaLarge whale and seal bones can be found lying on the sand. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaWhaling has always been a dangerous business, and there are many sailors and station workers  buried at the cemetery in Whaler’s Bay. A mudslide caused by volcanic activity covered most of the cemetery in the 1960s, but the grave of a carpenter who died in 1928 remains unscathed. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaAfter New Sandefjord was abandoned, attempts at establishing other permanent bases were thwarted by volcanic activity, with eruptions causing the evacuation of the island in the late 1960s. Pictured here is one of the abandoned research stations.

Despite still being considered an active volcano, Deception Island is now home to two summertime research stations, with Chile, Argentina and Britain all claiming sovereignty over the sub-Antarctic island.  (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaWhile the majority of Deception Island is covered in glaciers, extreme microclimates exist here, including steaming fumaroles and geo-thermally heated waters.

Nine different bird species nest on Deception Island and around its cliffs. Although scavenging birds and seals can be found along the shoreline, some wildlife avoid the island as the area is simply too warm for their ice-adapted bodies. (Chris Van Hove)Deception Island, AntarcticaBut other species thrive in the island’s dynamic environment, including one of the world’s largest chinstrap penguin colonies – easily identifiable by the small band under their chin. 

In the background is [Aurora Expedition’s](http://www.auroraexpeditions.com.au/) Polar Pioneer, one of the tourist ships that visit Deception Island during the summer season of November to March.

MenuLoadingAntarctica’s volcanic ice cavesShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinLocated in one of Earth’s coldest spots, Mount Erebus is the southernmost active volcano on the planet. Its caves are home to mysterious microbes that thrive in the blistering heat.Mount Erebus, Antarctica, volcano, caveMount Erebus is the most southerly active volcano on the planet. It began to form about 1.3 million years ago and today stands 	3,794m above sea level. Its slopes are covered with snow and ice, glaciers, crevasses and the occasional lava flow, but steam usually rises from its summit, betraying the intense heat within. If Erebus were a dessert, it would be a reverse Baked Alaska – frozen on the outside and hot in the middle. (Carsten Peter/National Geographic Stock)Mount Erebus, volcano, caves, AntarcticaThe volcano, including the frequency of its eruptions, the types of gases it gives off, and the age of its rocks, is well studied. But the thousands of microscopic organisms that live in the hot soils inside the caves near Erebus’ summit make up one of the planet’s least known ecosystems. It could also be one of the largest – some estimates suggest that one-third of all bacteria on the planet might live there – and weirdest. These microbes do not survive by drawing energy from the sun. Instead, they get energy from other sources, such as iron or hydrogen. (Carsten Peter/National Geographic Stock)Mount Erebus, cave, Antarctica, volcanoUntil recently the study of the microbes was problematic: if you could not grow it in the laboratory, how could you describe it, let alone study it? In the past decade or so, though, genetic techniques have been developed that allow whole communities of microbes to be characterised by their DNA alone, giving scientists a far more complete picture. A team of eight researchers explored the caves in 2012 using a drill to extract a sample of snow and ice accumulated over many years. The hope is that such samples will contain microbes from inside the volcano, giving a window into microbial life. (Carsten Peter/National Geographic Stock)Mount Erebus, Antarctica, volcano, cave, microbeHere, microbiologist Craig Cary peers underneath the blue dome of an ice cave, where he will take a soil sample to check for microbes. Although the volcanic soils themselves are hot – they can reach temperatures of 65C – the air just above is not. Move a couple of metres away from the hot spot, and the soil temperature drops sharply. These caves lie close to the surface, with only thin ice separating them from the outside world. Anyone walking outside the cave must take care or risk falling through. (Carsten Peter/National Geographic Stock)Mount Erebus, Antarctica, cave, volcanoInside the ice caves, frost crystals form from the volcano’s warm, wet air. Each crystal grows in a different shape depending on how the air currents flow. Here, a team member investigates the passages of Hut Cave, working to find the origin of the microbes that inhabit the caves.

MenuLoadingHunting the blue Yeti of BhutanShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Neelima Vallangi)By Neelima Vallangi10th August 2015Once thought to be a Himalayan myth, Bhutan’s national flower is a once-in-a-lifetime find.OOn a clear day, the entire Jomolhari Range – including Bhutan’s second highest peak and one of the country’s most sacred places – should be visible from where I was standing. But on that cold and gloomy June afternoon, all I could see were a blinding mist and grey skies.I was on the 3,780m-high Chele La mountain pass in west Bhutan, and despite the ominous monsoon weather, my guide Raj Lama sent me hiking up yet another trail to try to get a better view. I was not impressed, and I let him know.Passing through Chele La (Credit: Neelima Vallangi)Lama and I often argued during my week-long stay in the Himalayan Kingdom. One of our first arguments, in fact, was over Lama’s belief that Indian girls are not good hikers. I proved him wrong, trekking to the Tiger’s Nest Monastery with considerable ease the previous day. And in a “watch-what-you-wish-for” moment, that’s how I ended up on a nondescript trail with obscured views that afternoon, fielding subsequent prompts to hike every possible trail around.But as it turned out, the constant bickering had an upside: it led me to one of the rarest flowers on Earth.Bhutan’s national flower, Meconopsis Grandis, or Himalayan blue poppy as is it popularly known, is a flower so enchantingly blue that it instantly commands undivided attention. Growing only above the tree line in a harsh high altitude environment of 3,500m to 4500m, it blooms just once during the monsoon between late May to July, after which it disperses its seeds and dies.The majestic Himalayan blue poppy (Credit: Neelima Vallangi)This bloom is so rare, in fact, that it was once thought to be a Himalayan myth, like the Yeti. Its presence in Bhutan was only confirmed in 1933 by botanist George Sherriff, and to this day, it evokes similar intrigue to the snow leopard – the ghost of the Himalayas.As I reluctantly trudged my way further up the misty mountain towards the western ridge above Chele La, hundreds of large white Darchor prayer flags fluttered in the fierce winds that buffeted the exposed slopes. The lush pine forest that covered every inch of these pristine mountains had been cleared here. Instead, small and dense shrubs packed the landscape.Walking along the trailside, annoyed at my cold, wet mission, I suddenly noticed a profusion of orange and yellow bell-shaped blooms growing on dwarf rhododendron bushes. As I traipsed on, I found myself gaping at thousands of those same flowers drooping gracefully from the hundreds of shrubs that lined the entire slope. When I turned my gaze away from the rhododendrons, vivid bursts of yellow, white and purple caught my eye: I had just walked into a patch of primulas and primroses. To my right, bright yellow piptanthus contrasted the dull sky. For the first time since arriving in Bhutan more than five days ago, the opulence of the country’s floral diversity was apparent. Of course, I should have expected nothing less from a Himalayan Kingdom that has set aside 60% of its land as protected nature reserves.The bright yellow piptanthus (Credit: Neelima Vallangi)I have always been an ardent admirer of wildflowers. To me, the blooms epitomise the untamed elegance of nature and remind me of my childhood dreams full of meadows carpeted with colourful blossoms. Lost in this reverie, I trod lightly in an attempt to not crush any of these delicate beauties – when a bright burst of blue stopped me in my tracks.Obscured under a thick shrub between the wildflowers, a large cerulean bloom with a dazzling amber core hung delicately from a 60cm-tall slender green stalk. Its fragile beauty and unexpected hue startled me. The blue was as deep as the late afternoon Himalayan skies on a bright sunny day. There were at least 10 more such flowers around, some fresh and others more withered, but the colour of the petals was striking on them all. As I gazed on, time passed as though in a dream. Without even realizing, I had already spent close to an hour engrossed in my serendipitous encounter.The amber core and deep blue petals in full bloom (Credit: Neelima Vallangi)All annoyances forgotten, I cheerfully scampered back to the road where Lama was waiting, without an inkling of the rare privilege I had been blessed with. At that point, I had no idea it was the Himalayan Blue Poppy. I was just captivated by the intense colour, an effect I later learned it is often known to have on unwitting observers.As much as I enjoy wildflowers, I have little knowledge of them and simply take pleasure in their fleeting beauty. To me, a blue poppy could have been just as enticing as an orchid. But of the many beautiful flowers that grew in that small patch, none held my attention for as long as the blue poppy did – a true testament to its inescapable allure. Later that evening, when we arrived at Haa Valley on the other side of Chele La, I read up on the flower and learned about its significance. When I learnt how uncommon it was to spot a Himalayan Blue Poppy in the wild, I couldn’t help but smile at the strange quarrels with my guide and the incredulity of the circumstances that landed me at that exact location at exactly the right time. I’d found the mythical Himalayan Blue Poppy in a country steeped in mysticism.The Haa Valley from above (Credit: Neelima Vallangi)Share using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinShareAround the BBC

50 Reasons to Love the WorldMenuLoading50 Reasons to Love the World | Cultural TraditionsBhutan's 350-year-old recipe for wellbeingShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Simon Urwin)By Simon Urwin1st April 2021In this secluded kingdom, a secret incense formula believed to promote healing and happiness is known by only two people.50 Reasons to Love the World - 2021Why do you love the world?
""Because incense invokes peace of mind, and that is the basis of happiness. So with every incense wand I make, I can share that happiness with the world."" – Nado, incense maker
More Reasons to Love the WorldThe bare-breasted woman was standing on one leg in a field of flowers. She wore a golden crown and a necklace of rubies and emeralds; in her right hand she held a single, smoking wand.""That's Dugpoema, the Buddhist goddess of incense offering,"" said Nado, pointing to the screen print of the deity on his office wall in the Bhutanese capital of Thimphu. ""It is said that the Lord Buddha first created incense, then disciples such as Dugpoema disseminated it around the world. In many ways I feel like a disciple myself. I am doing the same work.""Nado – his only name, since the Bhutanese do not traditionally use surnames – then offered to show me around his incense-making workshop, Nado Poizokhang. The oldest and largest of its kind in the country, it produces sticks and powders that are sought-after in homes and monasteries across the Himalayan kingdom. Even the king personally requests incense from Nado Poizokhang to burn within the walls of the royal palace.Everything that goes into Nado's incense is organic, and much of it is harvested by nomadic yak herders in the Himalayas (Credit: Simon Urwin)""I believe one of the reasons my incense is so well-regarded and its effects are so powerful is because of the incredible purity of the ingredients,"" Nado said, before opening the door to a storeroom piled high with dried spices, botanicals and evergreens. ""Everything is 100% organic: from the great boughs of juniper – the base ingredient in all Bhutanese incense – to the most delicate of jatamansi flowers that render the richly scented essential oil spikenard. Other incense makers may use chemicals and low-grade materials to cut costs – but that just weakens the healing properties of incense and can leave you with a headache or feeling agitated upon burning. Here the focus is on quality.""Many of the medicinal plants and leaves that Nado uses are harvested by nomadic yak herders at high altitudes to ensure that they are free of toxins and contaminants. ""They live a hard life, but the harvest provides them with extra income,"" he said. ""That good deed sets ripples of good karma in motion before a single stick is made or burned.""In Bhutan, burning incense is an almost compulsory ritualThe timing of the harvest is key. Nado explained that the optimal period is the month after Thrue-Bab, the Blessed Rainy Day, which marks the end of the monsoon. ""During that time, the sun warms the leaves and petals after they've been nourished by months of rain; it helps me produce a wonderful, rich perfume. And that perfume is vital in order for incense sticks and powder to work their age-old magic.""The offering of scent and smoke has a long history and a deep cultural significance in Bhutan, where it is traditionally burned twice daily. ""In other countries, incense may be used solely for ceremonies, but in Bhutan it's also how we start and end each day,"" said Nado. ""It's an almost compulsory ritual.""While incense is widely used across Asia during religious ceremonies, in Bhutan, it is burned twice a day (Credit: Roberto Schmidt/Getty Images)To this day, incense is still utilised as it has been for centuries, in one of two ways: powder or stick. The powdered version is the smokier of the two and is burned on hot embers in homes, monasteries and temples. It is used as both an offering to the gods and as a fumigant to cleanse sacred rooms and holy objects, placate malicious spirits, and eradicate negative energy. Incense sticks are similarly used to make offerings, but they are also burned for their therapeutic properties.""The gentle release of scented smoke nourishes the mind and stimulates the senses,"" said Nado. ""That brings about pleasure and, in turn, mental tranquillity. My own recipe for incense can do all that, but also free blocked energy and cure many kinds of sickness, too.""You may also be interested in: • Hong Kong's guardian of the gods • Hunting the blue Yeti of Bhutan • The scent that's pricier than goldNado's all-natural formula for good health and happiness remains a tightly guarded secret known only to him and his daughter, Lamdon. He explained that it is based on a widely known recipe from the Mindrolling Tibetan Bhuddist Monastery in India that is more than 350 years old.""I've adapted it though, because the original quantities of saffron were so great that today it would make the incense extremely expensive and out of reach for ordinary people,"" he said. ""I've also blended it with another recipe from the Drukpa Kagyu school of Buddhism to enhance the perfume and maximise its healing powers. I use some 30 ingredients in my regular incense, and 108 in the version reserved for important religious ceremonies. The number 108 is auspicious for Buddhists and this special version can only be made on a holy day, according to Buddhist astrological charts.""Monks sort boughs of juniper – which is the base ingredient in all Bhutanese incense – to make Nado's secret formula (Credit: Simon Urwin)To make the incense, the various ingredients (including bark, spices, woodchips, flowers and leaves) are powdered in the workshop's milling room. While the team members who help with this stage know roughly what goes into making incense, they don't know the exact proportions, Nado explained. ""And they certainly don't know what's in the cup that I put in at the end.""What he does reveal is that the powder intended for direct burning is mixed with extra medicinal herbs to guarantee more smoke before being sent for packaging; while the powder for sticks is blended with water, honey and a natural purple dye to form a dough that is left to gently ferment in a large vat for up to a week.Burning incense is as important as the food that we eat, the water we drink and the air that we breathe""I think of it like a treasure chest,"" Nado said, slowly lifting the lid to allow me to peek inside and inhale the yeasty-floral aroma. ""Many people would love to get their hands on the riches inside.""As the dough ferments, Nado and his team keep close watch over it, since it is easy for a batch to spoil. ""It's why so much we do here is done by hand. It is craftsmanship, not mass production.""Fermented dough soon becomes spools of soft incense (Credit: Simon Urwin)Nado then led me to the extruding room to see the next stage of the stick-making process. There, Gyenzang, one of Nado's team of 12 female production workers, was feeding handfuls of fermented dough into the hopper of a machine that transformed the clay-like paste into spools of soft incense within seconds.""Making incense is a process that must come from the heart,"" she said, catching the plum-coloured coils on a tray as they spilled from the extruder's nozzles. ""This is a job that all of us love dearly. None of us received a good education; we'd have otherwise struggled to find work if it weren't for Nado,"" she added, before passing the tray to her co-worker, Yeshey, for straightening.""The job is empowering,"" said Yeshey, as she rolled the incense out flat along the edge of a wooden block. ""We can earn money and feel independent from our husbands and our families. The work has given us all greater self-esteem. We feel the benefit of Nado's kindness and are happy to know that all of the good deeds and positivity involved in the incense-making process will be passed on to the finished product and the people that burn it.""A team of workers straighten and then cut the incense spools to make sticks (Credit: Simon Urwin)After straightening is complete, the incense sticks are sent to be air-dried in the attic, then trimmed to size and tied into bundles ready for market. ""We make around 20,000 wands and 350kg of powder a month,"" Nado said. ""We now export to as far away as China, the US and the UK. But while this is a business that earns me a living, money in no way precedes the spiritual importance of what I do. Making incense has been part of my Buddhist devotion for more than 50 years. It is my calling. And it gives me great personal satisfaction because I see with my own eyes how the people benefit from incense. Come with me, I'll show you.""Within just a single stick there is enormous powerNado and I set off down the forested hillside towards the centre of Thimphu, and en route, he told me how he had discovered his purpose in life. ""I joined the monkhood at 15 and stayed for 10 years,"" he said. ""I excelled at calligraphy, and when the third King of Bhutan asked for the Buddhist canon to be written in gold script, I was recruited for the task. After I'd finished, I wanted to find something equally fulfilling that mixed the creative with the sacred, and that led me on the path to making incense.""In downtown Thimphu we entered the vast Centenary Farmer's Market; its ground floor dedicated to fruit and vegetables, the upper level filled with incense products that promised to relieve abdominal pain, aid relaxation and assist in carrying out exorcisms.Burning incense is a practice that unites everyone in Bhutan (Credit: Keren Su/Getty Images)At one stall we chatted with a woman named Choden, who often burned Nado's incense in the temple shrine near her home and was purchasing a fresh supply of scented wands.""Just as I brush my teeth, I also burn three incense sticks in the morning and three at night,"" she said. ""I would feel incomplete if I didn't do it. It is a ritual that was passed down to me by my ancestors, and I have passed it on to my children. Burning incense is as important as the food that we eat, the water we drink and the air that we breathe. It is a practice that unites us all – rich and poor.""We continued to a monastery that Nado supplies with his incense. There, in a sunlit prayer room, a monk was gently swinging a censer, the aromatic smoke spilling from its perforated lid to permeate the air and infiltrate the folds of his garments. ""When I perform the puja (a cleansing ceremony using burning powder) it removes any negative energy from the room and makes me feel spiritually, bodily and mentally clean,"" he said. ""Incense helps me focus my mind for prayer and develop as a human being. It helps me to become the best possible version of myself.""Nado's incense fills many censers that monks use to remove negative energy (Credit: Simon Urwin)Down the corridor in a study room, a group of monks were sitting cross-legged with their shaved heads buried deep inside their prayer books, each with a smoking wand by their side.
""I believe that within just a single stick there is enormous power,"" said one of the monks, named Wangchuk. Nado nodded in agreement.
""Incense can remove bad omens and obstacles from the path of life,"" Wangchuk continued. ""It creates a way for people to be kinder to each other. Incense is a key that can open the door to happiness.""

MenuLoadingCultural ActivitiesBhutan, the kingdom of the cloudsShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinBy Peter Grunert17th May 2012The Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan is a place where Buddhist traditions mix with modernity, and reverence is shown to tigers and the flaming thunderbolt of wisdom.TThe edge of a forest cloaked in clouds, thick with the scent of pine and garlanded with peach blossoms, a sign reads ‘Please do not tease the animals’. Here live the takins of Thimpu.Related slideshow: Cloistered BhutanA local legend tells how the Bhutanese
national animal was created from the remains of a lunch eaten by Lama Drukpa
Kunley, a 15th-century Buddhist saint also known as ‘the Divine Madman’. He
demonstrated the outlandish power of his magic by taking the skeleton of a cow
and the skull of a goat, theatrically combining the two before bringing them
back to life with a loud belch. 
And so one of nature’s more awkward
creatures was born. Today, a herd of takins lives within a refuge at the edge
of Thimpu, the sleepy capital of a country the size of Switzerland with a total
population of just 700,000. In the 1990s, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, then king of
Bhutan, granted the takins freedom from the captivity of a zoo. This gesture
represented an early ripple before a wave of modernity was allowed to sweep
through his secretive mountain kingdom, a world all of its own between China
and the northeastern tip of India. The first tourists were only permitted to
come here in 1974, democracy wasn’t introduced until 2008, and there is now a
TV channel (just the one), showing a mixture of Hollywood, Bollywood and
spectacularly melodramatic local movies. 
The takins were poorly equipped to make
the most of their release, swaggering through town, lazily searching for food
and generally troubling the populace. There seemed little choice but to corral
them into Thimpu’s Motithang Takin Preserve, which offered a little more of the
space that their wild relatives enjoy at the opposite end of the country, in
the remote east. 
The job of guarding these hapless beasts
now falls to Kuenzang Gyeltshen, who lives with his young family in a hut
inside the boundaries of the preserve, weaving shawls and tending his garden of
herbs, garlic and chilli peppers. ‘I rise early to feed the takins, around
6am’, he says. Kuenzang does all he can to prevent visitors from offering the
national animal a taste of the national dish, ema datshi – a heart-quaking mix of
potent chillies and melted cheese that can wreak equal havoc on the digestive
systems of takins as those of unacclimatised foreigners. ‘People would be best
to stick to giving them the occasional apple,’ he suggests. 
A menagerie of even more peculiar animals
is to be found in Thimpu’s National Institute for Zorig Chusum, also known as
The Painting School. Here the traditional crafts of Bhutan are taught to a
fresh generation. In the wood-carving classroom, the heads of a tiger, leopard,
boar, owl, snake, deer, dog, ox, rabbit, dragon and a mythical bird called a
garuda all snarl down at onlookers. Each has a fearsome set of fangs exposed –
even the owl and rabbit. The students are creating masks that will be gaudily
painted in the style of those worn by performers at the tsechus – religious
festivals – held across the country as the grip of the long Himalayan winter
releases each spring. 
In the classroom next door, 21-year-old
Dechen Dema gulps hard as her tutor, Dawa Tshering, presents the artwork she
must attempt to replicate. This is a fiendishly complex sculpture of
Avalokites´vara, a Buddhist god of compassion with multiple heads and spindly
limbs that today need to be worked from soft clay. Dechen’s shyness belies her
great dexterity as she sets about her task. ‘My family are very proud of my
progress,’ she says. ‘None of them would know how to make something like this.’
Dechen considers herself fortunate to be a pupil; prior to 1998, tradition
prevented girls from being admitted to the school. 
The end of the day’s studies are
signalled by the echoing clang of a brass bell being struck outside. A portrait
of Bhutan’s youthful current king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, looks down
handsomely and sternly as pupils file past a locker with ‘I feel better when
I’m drunk’ scratched in graffiti on its door. 
Glorious frescoes adorn most homes and
religious buildings throughout Bhutan, with creatures, flowers and intricate,
abstract patterns sprawling over broad wooden beams and mud walls. One symbol
that frequently looms up on the walls of houses here, with an alarming level of
anatomical accuracy, is the ‘flaming thunderbolt of wisdom’ – a sturdy male
member believed to protect the occupants of a building from harm. 
The owner of the original flaming
thunderbolt of wisdom was the Divine Madman himself, Lama Drukpa Kunley. The
saint still holds much influence over fast-evolving Bhutan. He is said to have
shot an arrow from his homeland of Tibet, determined to deliver his unusual
form of wisdom to the lucky girl closest to where it landed. He claimed he
would break down all social conventions in order to encourage worshippers to
consider the teachings of Buddha with an open mind. Bawdy language, reeling
drunkenness and outrageous sexual exploits were among his techniques, inspiring
certain traditions that continue right to this day. 
In the east of Bhutan, a practice known
as ‘night hunting’ is only now being widely called into question. Young men
will make a girl’s acquaintance during the day to seek her consent for a
one-night stand, then break into her parents’ house to fulfil that promise as
night closes in. If they leave soon afterwards then often nothing more will be
said, but if they doze off and are caught by the girl’s parents after daybreak,
they will be duty-held to marry her. Tales abound of queues of impatient
suitors forming outside the houses of popular girls, of overweight boys
becoming stuck in window frames, and of mothers being accidently approached in
the confusion of darkness. 
If machismo, a love of Buddhism and a
certain urge to handle a weapon are long-respected traits in Bhutan, it may not
seem so bizarre to learn that leathery Hollywood action hero Steven Seagal –
star of Under Seige and countless similar movies – is one of the country’s
favourite celebrities. In recent years, he made a widely publicised visit to
Bhutan and has been proclaimed the reincarnation of a holy 13th-century
Buddhist treasure hunter. 
Inspired by the example of the Divine
Madman, Bhutanese men still enjoy firing arrows over great distances. Just as
the takin is the national animal and ema datshi the national foodstuff, so
archery is the national sport. At one end of a field in the mist-shrouded
countryside near Thimpu, Karma Dhendup is lining up a distant target, 140 metres
away. He is a teacher turned tour guide for guests of the capital’s plush Taj
Tashi hotel, and like many upwardly mobile Bhutanese men, he has foregone a
traditional bamboo bow for the status symbol of a high-tech carbon-fibre
compound bow. ‘Some invest half a year’s salary in one of these,’ he says. 
Bhutanese archery is a highly sociable,
often alcohol-fuelled affair with a hint of amiable danger thrown in. Women
assume the dual roles of cheerleaders and hecklers, noisily calling into
question any inaccurate archer’s prowess. Today there’s no pause in the
shooting as a cow and a couple of farmhands casually amble across the middle of
the field. 
Karma’s work involves offering visitors
cultural insights and guiding them around a baffling assortment of dzongs, the
monumental fortified monasteries to be discovered at every turn in Bhutan.
Close to Thimpu and accessed by a steep climb on foot – equally breathtaking
for its panoramic views over valleys dense with the blooms of rhododendrons and
the fight for oxygen in the thin mountain air – is the Tango Goemba. Here, a
privileged glimpse can be had of the gilded statues of Buddha within its inner
sanctum, and boy monks learn English grammar, Buddhist philosophy and soccer
skills. Also near the capital is the Pangri Zampa, a monastic temple used as a
school of astrology, where a ceremony is under way to bless the country for the
year ahead. Pungent clouds of incense fill the air as groups of monks chant,
blow slender trumpets and perform whirling acrobatic dances while dressed as
mythical heroes. Local people spin prayer wheels and present offerings of
imported snacks to the monks, building a vast mound of crisps, biscuits and
popcorn. 
The tour hurtles on over sinuous
mountain roads to the imposing Paro Dzong, a combined magistrate’s court and
place of worship, then to the ruined Drukgyel Dzong, where defensive
passageways burrow off into the hillsides, and onwards to Kyichu Lhakhang, one
of the oldest structures in Bhutan, claimed to have been built in 659 AD to pin
down the left foot of an ogress who had inflicted chaos across the region. 
Eastwards over the high Dochu La pass,
sitting at the convergence of two rivers fed by meltwater from glaciers, is the
beautiful Punakha Dzong, ‘the palace of great happiness’ where wild bees make
their nests in the rafters and kings have their coronations. A short way
further on is the Chimi Lhakhang, the temple of the Divine Madman and a focal
point for his most ardent followers. Women who’ve been struggling to conceive
often spend the night here, having heard of the miraculous results the saint
can deliver through a blessing known as a ‘wang’. Visitors are greeted by a boy
monk offering cups of holy water, accompanied by a ceremonial tap on the head
with a bow and arrow and a 12-inch mahogany phallus. Photography, though
tempting, is discouraged. 
The magic thunderbolt of wisdom is much
in evidence on the thick-set walls of farmhouses in the surrounding rice
fields. Karma says: ‘We have a saying, “Protect your house with a phallus, protect
your phallus with a condom!”. This is modern Bhutan.’ For him, contemporary
life means wearing the national costume of a gho – a cloak worn over
knee-length socks – during the day and a tracksuit in the evening. It means a
life shared on Facebook, choosing Bob Marley & The Wailers’ Three Little
Birds as the hold music on his smartphone, and recalling Stephen Hawking’s
teachings about space and time with the same reverence as the Buddhist
philosophy his country has so long been enveloped in. 
Most of Karma’s clients are eager to
visit the Taktshang Goemba, or Tiger’s Nest. This monastery was built at the
place where Guru Rinpoche – another of the country’s favourite religious
figures – is said to have arrived on the back of a consort he’d transformed into
a flying tigress. Legend tells that he went on to subdue a local demon before
spending three months here meditating in a cave. 
We plan to approach the Tiger’s Nest the
long way round, across the craggy spines of the surrounding mountains rather
than up the well-made path from the car park a couple of hours below. The
two-day route follows part of a smuggler’s trail that continues to Tibet, where
Bhutanese men in bleached jeans and knock-off Nike trainers guide pony trains
laden with Chinese medicines, radios and DVD players. The trail passes through
cloud forests draped with tendrils of moss, over ridges where trees have been
contorted sideways by the prevailing winds and eagles drift far above. Beyond
lie the sacred, unclimbed peaks of Bhutan’s tallest mountains, rising more than
7,000 metres and capped with snow throughout the year. 
The trail opens onto a high plateau
where yak herders seek shelter in winter and the Uma Paro hotel establishes a
tented camp in the spring and summer. Guests spend the night in these
gale-shaken tents before heading to the Tiger’s Nest at first light. 
As dusk settles, the smoke of a warming
bonfire mingles with flakes of snow dropping all around, our lungs aching from
the altitude. Whispers turn to the mythical yetis that have been given their
own national park in the east, and of a population of tigers recently tracked
by government rangers within sight of this camp. For generations, monks living
at the peak’s summit have told of watching a ghostly tigress stalk the surrounding
plateau under the light of a full moon, wondering if they were witnessing the
reappearance of the flying tigress once ridden by the founder of the Tiger’s
Nest monastery. 
A black billy goat with horns painted
bright yellow has been dragged up here by two men seeking the karmic benefits
of saving him from being slaughtered for a feast. They deliver the goat into
the freedom of one of Bhutan’s most sacred high places, abandoning him to the
wilderness in the process. He bleats pitifully all night, fearing unseen
predators, desperately latching on to our party as we descend towards the
Tiger’s Nest at dawn. A few hours later, the goat appears to express joy and
relief at being handed over to some monks who tend a collection of similarly
abandoned creatures in their idyllic mountainside farm. He will spend the rest
of his days here, safely cloaked by the comfort of tradition, looking out over
a country where the wild is always close at hand. 
Ahead is the Tiger’s Nest, a shimmering
monument with golden pinnacles to its rooftops set over stark, whitewashed
walls that somehow cling to the cliff face. From the path where pilgrims gather
to look on in awe, ropes bearing prayer flags in a rainbow of colours are
strung over a deep gorge towards the monastery. These carry the wishes of
believers off on the breeze, spiralling them across the valley beyond – full of
hope for the present and wonder at a future once unimagined in this kingdom of
the clouds.Share using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinShareAround the BBC

MenuLoadingTravel Journeys | Remote PlacesA journey to the Disappointment IslandsShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Andrew Evans)By Andrew Evans20th March 2019In 1765, an English explorer gave two islands a rather unfortunate name that has sheltered them from the world and preserved one of Earth’s last paradises.(This year, we published many inspiring and amazing stories that made us fall in love with the world – and this is one our favourites. Click here for the full list).Lord Byron’s grandfather was having a bad day.Scurvy had taken down his crew on the HMS Dolphin, forcing them into their hammocks where they swayed in the sticky heat of the tropics as their ship listed slowly across the Pacific.Eager to control the South Atlantic, the British Navy had tasked Admiral Byron with settling an island off the South American coast where ships could resupply, and then finding an alternative route to the East Indies. By the time he finally returned to England, he had set a record for circumnavigating the globe in less than two years; claimed the western Falkland Islands for the Crown; and nearly started a war between Great Britain and Spain in the process.Byron sailed away, marking his frustration onto a new map of the world by naming these atolls the ‘Islands of Disappointment’But after rounding the tip of South America, the explorer confronted the world’s largest body of water: the endless Pacific Ocean. After a month of empty blue horizon, a tiny island appeared. Byron noted the date (Friday 7 June 1765), and joyously described the island’s “beautiful appearance – surrounded by a beach of the finest white sand – and covered with tall trees, which… formed the most delightful groves”.Tall coconut groves fill the interior of Tepoto, in French Polynesia (Credit: Andrew Evans)The naval officer watched as his crew crawled onto the deck, “gazing at this little paradise” that was green with abundant young coconuts whose vitamin-rich meat and milk could heal their bleeding gums. Alas, Byron quickly ascertained that it was impossible to land. “I could not forbear standing close round the island with the ship,” he wrote in his daily log. With the high surf and a shallow coral shoreline that dropped starkly into the bottomless blue, there was no safe anchorage.Then there were the natives, noted Byron, who showed up on the beach brandishing 5m-long spears. The islanders set massive signal fires to warn a neighbouring island of the impromptu invaders. “The natives ran along the shore abreast of the ship, shouting and dancing,” Byron recalled, waving their long spears as a warning.“They would kill us… if we ventured to go on shore,” wrote Byron, who attempted one more landing in a longboat before giving up. “[They] set up one of the most hideous yells I had ever heard, pointing at the same time to their spears, and poising in their hands large stones which they took up from the beach.” The British made a go at frantic diplomacy by throwing old bread at the islanders, who refused to touch the stale food but instead waded into the water and tried to swamp the longboat.Byron backed off and instead set sail towards the larger neighbouring island, but he again failed to anchor along the ringed coral atoll. Meanwhile, natives armed with spears and clubs followed the longboat in the surf, using “threatening gestures to prevent their landing”. Byron only convinced the islanders to back off when he shot a 9lb cannonball over their heads. Less than 20 hours after arriving, Byron sailed away, marking his frustration onto a new map of the world by naming these atolls the ‘Islands of Disappointment’. The map was published following his round-the-world journey, and the moniker has stuck ever since.RediscoveryI laughed out loud when I first spotted the name in Byron’s sea log during a bout of insomnia, and was instantly hooked, reading line by line through the night until dawn. The name, now commonly listed as ‘Disappointment Islands’, sounded more like the title of some back-shelf Tintin comic than a real place on Earth. But the name checked out online, pointing to Napuka and Tepoto, a pair of far-flung dots in the South Pacific, etched upon the blue surface of the Tuamotu Archipelago, the largest group of coral atolls on the planet.Peering down on Google Earth, the smaller of the two Disappointment Islands resembled a single-cell organism floating alone in the ocean. Measuring just 4 sq km, Tepoto is one of the smallest of the 118 islands and atolls that comprise French Polynesia. This green teardrop banded by sandy beach upon a deep blue ribbon is also the tiny island where Byron failed to land. Could I get there, and would I be disappointed, too?No hotels, no restaurants, no tourist industry – it sounded like paradise to meAnd yet, 254 years after Byron’s attempt, the Disappointment Islands still proved difficult to access. Flights to the larger atoll of Napuka are not even listed on Air Tahiti’s international website. I spent three weeks making cold calls before I got hold of an agent.“You can fly to Napuka in February,” she explained in French, “but then you have to stay a full month.” And so I travelled in the better weather of May, when scheduled flights still gave me a minimum eight-day stay. Located nearly 1,000km from Tahiti’s capital, Papeete, Napuka is one of the most isolated islands in French Polynesia, and a quick stop on a larger circular air route. Once I stepped off the plane, I would have to stay.“You should arrange a place to stay beforehand,” my friend Celeste Brash recommended. She had never been to Napuka, but as the author of Lonely Planet’s Tahiti & French Polynesia guidebook, she spoke from personal experience: “Those really remote atolls in the Tuamotus don’t really know what to do when visitors show up.”No hotels, no restaurants, no tourist industry – it sounded like paradise to me. This was my ultimate desire as a traveller: to show up unannounced like those ailing British sailors, open to the naked fate of true exploration. I opted out of scurvy and long months at sea in favour of the 18-hour flight to Tahiti from Washington DC, measured out in cups of fresh pineapple juice poured by flight attendants wearing floral prints. After a night in Papeete, I boarded a two-hour prop plane to Napuka.JourneyFor the first hour, I watched the empty ocean far below me. The blue intensity astonished me as much as the immensity of the water. Polynesia is believed to be one of the last areas on Earth settled by humans, and that ancient people sailed across this void in narrow canoes from places like Indonesia and the Philippines seemed nearly impossible. Resting my forehead against the vibrating window, I studied the leathery surface of the mid-morning Pacific, basking in that rare moment when stark geographic truths confront you: Polynesia is more ocean than anything else.The Disappointment Islands are part of the Tuamoto Archipelago, a chain of nearly 80 islands (Credit: Andrew Evans)Faint white rings of coral atolls appeared – les îles basses, or ‘low islands’ of the Tuamotus. We dropped in tight circles and landed on the atoll of Fakarava, where at least half the 20 passengers departed. Ten minutes later we were back in the air, hovering over an even longer stretch of blue.Another hour passed before I recognised tiny Tepoto – alone in the ocean, single and miniscule, exactly like on my computer screen back home. The plane veered right and the larger atoll of Napuka filled my oval window view, like a turquoise boomerang encircling a long necklace of white coral islets. Right before we landed, I saw a flash of metal rooftops and green palm groves, a few dirt roads and a pointed church steeple.As the doors opened, thick, hot air saturated the plane and I dashed across the tarmac and into the shade of the Napuka Airport – a small, open-air shelter just off the runway, stacked with luggage and cargo. It seemed as if the whole island had come to meet the plane – the first flight to land in weeks. Families rushed towards us and flung fragrant flower leis around the necks of loved ones. As the lone foreigner, I stood apart, awkwardly watching the ritual of welcome, already feeling invasive and uncomfortable. Though I had travelled 12,000km, a great divide remained. I did not belong in this scene, and everybody there knew it.“Are you here on holiday?” a younger man asked me in French, heaving a duffle bag into the shade.I smiled and shrugged. “Oui.” It was easier than explaining how late-night Googling and reading the diary of an 18th-Century sea captain had led me to embark on this indulgent quest.We chatted. His name was Jack, and he and his colleague Evarii were electronic technicians from Tahiti, servicing all the tsunami warning sirens in French Polynesia. They had come to repair the siren on Tepoto, which is only accessible by boat from Napuka, and like me, they would have to stay eight days before the next flight back. But why had I come? Jack asked me. Where would I stay? Did I understand that there were no ‘services’ on Napuka?Evarii seemed annoyed by my presence.“Do you do this often?” he asked. “Just show up in a place without any plans?” Before I could tell him yes, in fact, this was my favourite way to travel, Jack intervened.“I’ll talk to la mairesse. We’ll figure something out.”The only way to Napuka is aboard an irregular two-hour prop plane from Tahiti's capital, Papeete (Credit: Andrew Evans)As if stepping out of a Gauguin painting, a woman soon approached me with a flowing bright skirt and a wide straw hat pinned with flowers that shaded her face. Her name was Marina and as tavana (‘mayor’, in Tahitian) of the 300-person atoll, she oversees everything that happens on Napuka, including every flight that lands at the airport.“Why did you not contact us to let us know you were coming?” tavana Marina asked me. “We have made no arrangements!” I fumbled an unconvincing response, saying that I didn’t want to be a burden.“Do you want to visit Tepoto?” tavana Marina asked, because a boat had already been organised for the technicians. Yes, I wanted to visit Tepoto. That was Byron’s first elusive island, and aside from the once-a-month supply boat, there was no way to reach it. I jumped at the chance.“Come with us,” said Jack, smiling. Evarii huffed.“You know there’s no water over there!” Evarii mentioned as he looked over my meagre luggage. I knew. I had practically memorised the Wikipedia entry: ‘These islands are arid, and are not especially conducive to human habitation’. I had a few litres of water in my bag, but it was barely enough for one day, let alone a week.“We can share,” Jack said. We drove in the back of tavana Marina’s pickup truck to the short cement dock, where a small metal skiff was hanging by steel cables from a front-loading tractor. I helped load the tiny boat with supplies, including a massive cooler of drinking water the technicians had checked as cargo from Tahiti. In a flash, the front loader dropped the skiff into the water, and two drivers jerked the outboard motors to life. The three of us hopped inside, and with a burst of engine, broke through the surf.ArrivalOut past the reef, the sea was calm with a light swell that rapidly pushed us north-west from Napuka towards the vague horizon. Aside from the wind, the only sound was the buzzing of twin outboard motors that carried our tiny party out into the heart of the ocean. In all my travels and ocean crossings, I had never felt this vulnerable on the water. I was seated on a boat the size of a kitchen table, floating atop the bluest and emptiest part of the globe without a speck of land in sight. The fringe of palms on Napuka had disappeared behind us, and for a solid 10 minutes, the blank horizon met my gaze from every direction, blue upon blue.And yet I felt an inherent trust towards my Polynesian crewmates. I had dropped my life into their hands and watched as they read the changing currents like road signs. Their eyes focused on the horizon and their fingers twitched the angle of the motor by half an inch, this way and that, steering us towards the invisible target of an island so tiny you could miss it and not even know.A front-loading tractor must use steel cables to raise and lower boats into the surf (Credit: Andrew Evans)“No GPS!” cried Evarii, shouting over the engine. He nodded to the drivers and tapped the side of his head. “They just know where to go.”Twenty minutes and 10km later, a thin green stripe of land pushed up from the water, followed by the white coral beach against the blue-green surf. After another 20 minutes, the island came into full view: coconut palms waving left and right, just as Byron had seen so long ago.Unlike the admiral, I landed successfully on Tepoto. In time with the rising and falling waves, I hopped onto the short dock and watched another front loader pluck the boat right out from the sea. It made perfect sense that an 18th-Century British tall ship would fail to find harbour here. The island was nothing more than a sharp and shallow reef that dropped off starkly into the dark blue depths, just as Byron had described.“Welcome to Tepoto,” a man in his late 30s said as he shook my salty hand and introduced himself as Severo, the island’s one and only policeman and the son of tavana Marina back on Napuka. She had called to tell him that I was arriving, and now a party of islanders was coming out to greet us. At the helm was a woman wrapped in a purple muumuu who dropped a string of white Tahitian gardenias around my neck, dousing me in a honey-vanilla perfume.“Bienvenue,” she said, kissing me on both cheeks and introducing herself as Louana.“Maururu,” I replied in Tahitian. Thank you.There is only one road on Tepoto and it's paved with crushed coral stone (Credit: Andrew Evans)Louana was the tavana of Tepoto, and she led us up from the beach, past the leaning palms to the single row of pastel bungalows that lined the island’s only street, paved with crushed coral stone.“Have you ever seen a four-headed coconut tree?” a young boy asked me in French, running alongside me.“No, I have not,” I answered.Have you ever seen a four-headed coconut tree?“We have one,” an older boy piped in. “It’s a coconut tree… with four heads!”I struggled to follow the excited rush of voices that came at me, each one a weird puzzle piece of information concerning this remarkable four-headed coconut tree – how nature made it comme ça – and how originally the trunk was split into seven heads, but those extra three broke off in a typhoon long ago. Several islanders offered to show me the arboreal wonder.Two hours after dropping into the Disappointment Islands without water or plans, I had a place to stay with the visiting technicians in a peeling-pink shack with plywood walls and cut-out squares for windows. Red-orange curtains printed with white hibiscus flowers flapped in the breeze as I sat sweating on the bed, adjusting to the 38C heat. Not only had I landed in Tepoto, but I had been welcomed.TepotoMinutes later, Severo buzzed by on his scooter with lunch cooked by his wife Tutapu: pan-fried snapper with rice, peas and coconut bread. The fish had been caught that morning and was more delicious than any I had ever eaten in a restaurant.While we ate, Severo sussed me out. As the island policeman, his job was to keep the peace and look after the welfare of the few dozen inhabitants, he explained. Most of the homes on Tepoto are wooden bungalows with cut-out windows (Credit: Andrew Evans)“It’s very tranquil here,” he said. “No real problems.” But now I had shown up and he kept looking into my eyes, as if trying to read my intentions. “I can’t remember the last time we had a visitor. Not for as long as I’ve been here – over 20 years now.”In fact, Severo said that no-one could recall the last time a non-Polynesian had come to Tepoto – certainly not in their lifetimes. Then, he told me that what I had read on Wikipedia was wrong: there weren’t 62 residents on the island, but closer to 40 now, 13 of which were children under the age of 12.“Young people leave,” he explained. Once they turn 12, the French government sends them to boarding school in Hao, another atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago 390km away. For high school, teenagers go to 
he main island of Tahiti. Severo had grown up on Napuka and returned there after high school, then married a girl from Tepoto and moved here.“What will you do while you’re here?” Severo asked.“Explore,” I answered, though I had made no real plans. I had not really thought past the possibility of getting here. Now that I had actually made it, the coming days confronted me. “Wait until it’s cooler,” he advised.Tepoto's residents are predominantly Catholic and often attend mass in the island's one church every day. (Credit: Andrew Evans)I dozed through the hot, humid afternoon and heard no other sounds except my own slow breathing that seemed to follow the rhythm of the whispering surf and listing palms. At 16:00, I followed the sound of a tinkling bell across the road, where most of the islanders sat on outdoor benches facing a shrine covered in garlands of flowers and chains of seashells. A musician played a guitar in one corner while the island’s nurse stood up and led the congregation in a strong and harmonious hymn.Still singing, a woman moved to one side, offering to share her bench with me. The Catholic mass lasted a full hour, rotating through chants and readings and hymns – all in Tahitian. Afterwards, the lady explained that this was the holy week of pilgrimage when islanders gathered twice a day before the Virgin Mary, the angelic figurine at the centre of the elaborate floral decor.“We are lucky here on Tepoto,” she said. “There is no war. No crime.” There were no real problems at all, she mused, lighting a hand-rolled cigarette. She also told me there was no running water or internet, and very limited electricity. Tepoto received its first solar panels and electric power in 1995, and a mobile phone tower within the last five years.“Have you ever seen a four-headed coconut tree?” she asked me, point blank.“No, I have not.”“We have one here, maybe the only one in the world,” she said with an air of mystery before saying goodbye and returning to her bungalow to untangle a hairy pig tied by one leg to a palm tree.Children help their parents fish in the shallow inner reef of Napuka (Credit: Andrew Evans)(Credit: Andrew Evans)Tuata, age 6, with a kitten on his home island of Tepoto (Credit: Andrew Evans)(Credit: Andrew Evans)Hautopa Raveino, age 10, plays a guitar in a tree on Napuka (Credit: Andrew Evans)(Credit: Andrew Evans)Of Tepoto's roughly 40 residents, 13 are children below the age of 12 (Credit: Andrew Evans)(Credit: Andrew Evans)Tutapu Kamake, the wife to Severo, the policeman on Tepoto (Credit: Andrew Evans)(Credit: Andrew Evans)Tavana Marina (right) and a friend (Credit: Andrew Evans)(Credit: Andrew Evans)Night fell fast and the stars blew me away. I gawked upwards from the empty beach as if catching the night sky for the first time, the Milky Way scrawled like a diagonal swath of pink gauze.The bell woke me before dawn, calling believers to another Catholic mass. This time I opted out and walked to the end of the one road, past the fanning palms and out to the coral shoreline. The sun rose behind me and lit up the sea like silver. I continued southwards, walking the length of the 2.6km island and admiring the tidal pools that housed tiny worlds of maroon-speckled crabs and green fish. Blue-eyed clams lay cemented in the rust-coloured coral and seabirds soared overhead.Massive white-stone crosses marked the cardinal points of the island, while the windward stretch of beach showed a collage of remnants that had floated in from the outside world: a whisky bottle; Chinese pharmaceuticals; a cracked CD case; a bottle of Japanese salad dressing; and a barnacled tennis shoe. I considered the long journey of the driftwood that now rested on this bit of shore. Where had it come from – Asia, the Americas or New Zealand? Tepoto was like some forgotten punctuation mark between all three.Massive white, stone crosses mark the four cardinal points of Tepoto (Credit: Andrew Evans)In three decades of travelling, I had never encountered such a raw and solitary place. The empty beaches and silent palm groves seemed timeless, as though a mirage of Byron’s ship still hovered somewhere off in the warm, salty breeze. I had seen this island depicted on old atlases and my grandfather’s globe and had somehow transported myself here – and yet, even my own footprints seemed implausible, as if I had stepped from my own reality into some far-flung dream state.Within days, I fell into the forced simplicity of the island: sleeping under a single cotton sheet; sipping instant coffee made using rainwater drained from the roof; eating raw clams; and then exploring every short footpath on the island. I bathed with a dipper of water from the rain barrel. Under the shade of trees and front porch roofs, I talked with the islanders and listened to their stories. At times I grew painfully thirsty, but kept silent, never asking for a drink. Yet somehow, the islanders always knew, sending their kids to gather fresh coconuts and then chopping them open and urging me to hydrate. I offered to pay and was always refused. In fact, I only handled money once, to pay Severo for my room and board.News that a foreigner had landed and was staying in the pink bungalow near the dock drifted across the tiny island. Occasionally, a few people stopped by in the evening to say hello, offer me a tour of the island or to ask me earnest questions. “How many houses do you have you in your town?”. “Are you a Christian?”. At times when I went off to explore, I caught glimpses of watchful eyes, peering at me through the palm fronds. They knew I was under the policeman’s care but remained on alert. I reacted by living with total transparency, down to my underwear drying on the clothesline.When it grew too warm, I swam in the ocean, the islanders watching from shore. Wearing goggles, I caught the flash of colour and life that swam beneath the waves – pastel fish whose scales matched the row of humble houses on Tepoto. Mounds of spiky coral glowed neon-like, healthy and unbroken, spared from the careless destruction of men. Rediscovering the ""Islands of Disappointment""Perhaps Byron’s disappointment had sheltered this place from the rest of the world, preserving it to this day. I’d seen the bleached and broken coral reefs of Bora Bora and Tahiti, where too much love has ruined the natural paradise that first put Polynesia on the tourist map. But here, halfway between the Marquesas and the main Tuamotu island groups, Tepoto has remained comparatively unblemished. I felt lucky to glimpse the vibrant and teeming underwater life, knowing that millions of tourists would visit the rest of Polynesia and never see this kind of virgin reef.Nor would they ever see the four-headed coconut tree. After days of anticipation, I received a personal invitation from three schoolboys – Tuata, Tearoha and Sylvain – who escorted me to the mayor’s office where the technicians were finishing up their work on the tsunami warning signal.A stumpy tractor with a wide shovel (the island’s only vehicle) had been dispatched for our adventure. Sylvain’s father André drove, while I rode inside the shovel with the technicians. In all, there were eight of us clinging to the tractor as we manoeuvred and bumped our way into the dense coconut grove at the island’s centre.Coconuts are the only cash crop on Tepoto, and as we pushed through the forest, I noticed small piles of halved coconuts, thick with hairy husks, drying in the sun. The oily white flesh, called copra, earns a fixed rate of 140 local francs (about £1) per kilogram, and is carried away once a month aboard a supply ship. Every islander has the right to collect and sell copra for cash, but André explained that the coconut trees had begun to die. A small invasive beetle was killing them, he said, making the leaves fall off and leaving bare, toothpick trunks poking into the air.After 20 minutes driving through the grove, the tractor stopped and the engine cut. I looked up and there it was, skinny and circumspect, barely noticeable except for the four branches that spun out from its base. The long fronds waved back in the wind.The residents of Tepoto are incredibly proud of their four-headed coconut tree (Credit: Andrew Evans)“It’s the four-headed coconut tree!” Tearoha shouted like a carnival barker. I stood in awe at the oddity before us and wondered how it came to be. By now I had heard the story from nearly every human on the island, how there had been seven branches, but three had broken off in the last major typhoon. The men began to recall different storms that had flattened the forest of trees in hours, and how the old people could predict a typhoon just from watching the birds. In the past, the islanders latched themselves to coconut palms to keep from being blown away by the gale-force winds. Now they had a siren triggered automatically from hundreds of kilometres away and the stone church to protect them.We took the long way back to the village, continuing first to the southern tip of the island. André pointed towards Napuka in the east, and standing on land instead of crouching in a boat, I could barely see it over the waves. A baby black-tipped reef shark hunted in the shallows, zipping after the schools of smaller fish.We followed the beach around towards the pink sunset, and I caught sight of my own footprints from days before ­– the only footprints on that side of the island. Just like Byron had marked his disappointment on a map of the world, I had left my own impressions in the sand of Tepoto. Another tide and my trail would be erased and redrawn with the winding trails of seabirds and coconut crabs.André stopped the tractor in front of his turquoise bungalow and leaned against a palm trunk. With a few swift chops of his machete, he hacked down fresh coconuts for all of us and handed me a whole litre of coconut water.Coconuts are the only cash crop on Tepoto and are hauled away once a month on a supply ship (Credit: Andrew Evans)“We may not have water,” said André, “but we can always drink coconuts.”That night, André, Severo and some of the other men of Tepoto gathered outside our pink house to drink beer and talk fishing. They spoke a mix of French, Tahitian and the local Tuamotuan language of Paumotu. I strained to fully understand their epic tales of catching bonito by the hundreds – the same bonito I had been served that day for lunch, raw, but with chopped onions and coconut milk.“Here, a gift,” said Joseph, a fisherman who handed me a handmade lure that he used to catch bonito. The sharpened metal hook was decorated with a carved mother-of-pearl spinner and a wild pig’s tail. In return, I gave him my goggles.This was a tiny solar-powered island without internet, cars or Starbucks. The technicians and I were the only outside influence, and I tried to make it count. During my last two days on Tepoto I taught Tuata and Tearoha how to play chess. The elementary school had a chessboard, but none of the children knew how to play. After hours of instruction, I had them play against one another. That night, Evarii challenged me to a game and we played into the evening. One by one, the Tahitian technician killed my pieces until only my tall white king remained, chased in circles by the black king and bishop.“Checkmate,” Evarii said.“No, wait,” Jack intervened in French. “C’est la nulle.” It was a draw. Neither of us had won. My plastic king was destined to wander the board aimlessly, and Evarii would never have the satisfaction of killing me. He went off to sulk in the last sunset I saw on Tepoto, when the sky lit up blue and green, then peach, rose and orange. Wood smoke scented the air and shooting stars lit the night. Jack played the ukulele, singing lovelorn Polynesian songs along with our hosts until well past midnight.Sunsets on Tepoto light the sky in blue, green, and then peach, rose and orange (Credit: Andrew Evans)NapukaThe next morning, the men launched the boat into the surf, lowering it with the tractor and plopping it into the turquoise shallow at just the right moment. Severo’s in-laws came with us. From time to time, they liked to visit family on Napuka.“You are welcome anytime,” said tavana Louana, dropping a string of polished cowrie shells around my neck.“Yes, come stay with us again,” said Severo, adding another necklace. André and the other islanders came and added their own hand-strung necklaces. By the time I climbed into the wobbling boat, my head bowed forward with the weight of shells around my neck. Five minutes later, Tepoto was nothing more than a whisper of green on the blue ocean.I spent three more days on Napuka, adjusting to the sudden noise and crowds of this 200-person metropolis. Severo’s mother-in-law had warned me, “On Tepoto, we don’t lock our doors, but on Napuka, we lock them.” Two hundred people were too many to trust, and unlike Tepoto, there were cars and at least three streets including the road to the airport.Fishing on Napuka with Evarii, Jack and Marama (Credit: Andrew Evans)Whether he was assigned or volunteered, the island’s fireman became my escort on Napuka. His name was tattooed across his muscled chest – Marama – and within an hour of landing, he had me knee-deep in the lagoon while he cracked open a live clam.“Eat it,” he said. “You need to taste how good our clams are.”I reached into the shell and pulled at the cool, gelatinous animal. Then I plopped it in my mouth, squishing down and biting through the salty and slimy flesh.“More. You left the best part,” Marama said. I cleaned out the shell and then slurped the juice like an oyster. Marama beamed. Was this some kind of test?“Most foreigners would never agree to eat a raw clam like you did,” Marama said. “But this is our culture. This is how we survive out here. You showed that you respect us.”I did respect them, but on Tepoto, I had also been eating clams for every meal – raw, pickled, cooked and curried. I never foraged on my own; to take anything from the island would be stealing, I thought. The islanders enforced their own quotas, but shared whatever they pulled from the sea with me.Marama told me he was on the Napuka island council that regulated the gathering of clams and coconuts. When there was no other food to be had, there would always be clams, and it was his job to maintain a sustainable population of both clams and coconuts.Frangipani grows wild on Napuka; the smaller, star-shaped Tahitian gardenia is a symbol of Tahiti (Credit: Andrew Evans)“How did you hear about Napuka?” Marama asked me, as we walked back towards town. I told him that I had read about the islands in a very old book.“Byron?” asked Marama with a smirk.“Yes,” I answered. “Byron came here in 1765.”“You know,” said Marama, “the people here are not very happy with Byron. He called us ‘The Islands of Disappointment’, right?” He laughed, “I wish people knew the truth about this place. You really have to know the people to understand.”“I know,” I said. “And now that I’ve been here, I know that Byron was wrong.”Indeed, it seemed impossible to feel disappointed in the scene that enveloped me at that moment. The sky seemed Photoshopped with evenly-spaced clouds, and the lagoon glowed the colour of California swimming pools. Twenty metre-high coconut palms danced slowly, and I had just made a new friend who would take me fishing the next day and then swimming at his favourite beach. He would introduce me to dozens of new friends, including Maoake Tuhoe, one of the oldest men on the island, who claimed I was the first foreigner he remembers coming to Napuka since, “those Peruvians passed by in that boat.”Upon further questioning, I discovered ‘those Peruvians’ were, in fact, a group of explorers aboard a raft led by Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl in 1947 that washed up in the Tuamotus 72 years ago.Marama would be there on the day I left, gifting me a necklace he had strung with large, fragrant flowers and kissing me on both cheeks like a brother. And I would leave him my favourite cowboy hat, the one that kept me from getting burned in the scorching South Pacific sun. He wore it as he waved to me on the plane.BackIt took a day of island hopping to get back to Tahiti, where I felt overwhelmed by everything: the traffic, the streetlights, the tourists and even the hot running water in my hotel batht
b. I had filled notebooks and hard drives with words and images from Napuka to Tepoto and back again, but I wanted a more professional opinion.“The Byron story is the only recorded account we have in which the Europeans arrived, yet failed to make contact with the natives,” said Jean Kapé, who grew up on Napuka and now serves as director of Tahiti’s l’Académie Paumotu, which is dedicated to preserving the language, culture and environment of the Tuamotu Islands. I had met Kapé’s brother in Napuka, and he had connected the two of us.Responding to Byron’s sense of disappointment, Kapé said: “If someone from somewhere else gives their opinion about a place, it’s already false, because that opinion is only based on what they know.”Byron’s unsuccessful landing represents the ultimate missed connection – a spark of static that failed to ignite. And yet, his failure may have spared Napuka the same fate as many islands in the South Pacific.Measuring just 4 sq km, Tepoto is one of the smallest and most remote of French Polynesia's 118 islands (Credit: Andrew Evans)“Napuka [and Tepoto] are the last places where you can witness the original vegetation of the Tuamotu islands,” Kapé said. The Paumotu language, which is only still spoken by an estimated 6,000 people, is also alive there, along with their customs – one of which is unbridled hospitality towards the rare visitors they receive from nearby islands.“[Welcoming others] is sacred to Polynesians. It is the soul of all humanity,” Kapé said. “But too often with history, foreigners are the ones holding the pen, hence a name like ‘The Disappointment Islands.’ But even Napuka and Tepoto are just nicknames. The islands’ real names tell a much fuller story of the place you just visited.”I cannot pretend to fully understand, or worse, attempt to convey such a beautiful and complex historyWe talked for hours, Kapé and I. Over and over, he tried to explain the islands’ many Polynesian names, like Te Puka Runga, “The Tree Where the Sun Rises” (Napuka); and Te Puka Raro, “The Tree Where the Sun Sets” (Tepoto), deciphering the complex dialect and the multiple hidden meanings behind each name. It encompassed centuries of stories that stretch back to the original inhabitants and their worldview when their universe was nothing more than the two islands, the surrounding ocean and the big sun that moved overhead.I listened carefully and took notes, but I cannot pretend to fully understand, or worse, attempt to convey such a beautiful and complex history with my own words. Rather than repeat Byron’s mistake of trying to name them from my limited understanding, I will keep silent – not from disappointment or neglect or laziness, but out of respect for this little piece of the world, unknown to so many, even in French Polynesia.I thanked Kapé for his generous time and shook his hand. Then he gave me a lift back into the centre of Papeete, where throngs of French and American tourists dug through racks of floral print shirts and souvenir tribal tattoos.“I forgot to ask,” Kapé said as I opened the door of his car. “On Tepoto, did they show you the four-headed coconut tree?”Travel Journeys is a BBC Travel series exploring travellers’ inner journeys of transformation and growth as they experience the world.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

The South Island’s 450km-long Southern Alps, known for their glaciers and glacial lakes, create an epic landscape that is well suited to hikers who want to enjoy dusk in serene isolation. (Annie Griffiths/National Geographic Creative)cambodia beach sunset eventideAsia’s capacious beaches remain one of the most tranquil locales for ending the day. In Sihanoukville, Cambodia, vacationers can watch the sun set over Ochheuteal Beach, as they sip cocktails and await nightfall by the light of tiki torches. (Kris LeBoutillier/National Geographic Creative)greece santorini sunsetSantorini is one of 220 Greek islands that were created by the Minoan eruption, a volcanic explosion that divided up a single island into today’s beloved archipelago. Made picturesque by whitewashed buildings and an arid landscape, Santorini is a hedonist’s dream, with a slew of beaches, bars and infinity pools from which to enjoy the setting sun. (Michael Melford/National Geographic Creative)great plains kansas sunsetKansas – best known for flat landscapes, agriculture and the Wizard of Oz – was once the bed of an immense inland sea that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico through to the Arctic Ocean. It took millions of years for tallgrass prairie to cover near 170 million acres of North America, and just one century to develop and destroy it. At present, a mere 4% of prairie remains, mostly in the Kansas Flint Hills, where the lack of mountains and a [nature preserve](http://www.nps.gov/tapr/index.htm) make for stunning sundowns. (Jim Richardson/National Geographic Creative)baja mexico sunset californiaThe small island of San Esteben in Mexico’s Gulf of California is part of the greater landmass known as Baja California. Home to a variety of unusual reptiles and once inhabited by the Seri people, today it is common to see both researchers and travellers navigating the rugged terrain and the surrounding Sea of Cortez. The renowned sunrises and sunsets of Baja seem to fall over the horizon and bow off the face of the Earth. (Ralph Lee Hopkins/National Geographic Creative)polynesia tuamotu archipelago fakarava sunsetFakarava, located in French Polynesia’s Tuamotu Archipelago, is a 60km-long, 21km-wide strip of unsullied paradise. It is also a designated Unesco Biosphere Reserve due to the rare birds, plants and crustaceans who call the atoll home. With fewer than 1,000 residents living in two charming villages separated by an extensive lagoon, Fakarava is a popular destination for honeymooners who know the sunsets are hard to miss. (Aaron Huey/National Geographic Creative)Kiribati pheonix islands sunsetLocated smack in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the island nation of Kiribati borders the International Date Line at its easternmost point. This makes it one of the last places on the planet to experience sundown, and the undeveloped landscape makes it one of the most beautiful. Pictured here is the view from Kiribati’s Phoenix Islands, a name whose origins have been lost to history. At the end of the day, however, the name seems especially appropriate for the embodiment of this fiery sunset and its mythological counterpart.

MenuLoadingTahiti’s iridescent wondersShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinBy Lavya Yalamanchi11th July 2013Sift past the sandy beach and into the little-known world of Oceania’s most extraordinary export, the black pearls of Polynesia.Black Pearls, French PolynesiaFrench Polynesia, a sandy archipelago in the middle of the sparkling blue Pacific, is best known for the tropical island of Tahiti. This idyllic enclave is as valued for its crystal waters and black sand beaches as it is for the unique pearls that bear its name. The pride of Polynesia, the best Tahitian pearls are valued for their flawless, spherical surfaces and deep blue-green hues, although they can come in many shapes and sizes. 

Black pearls are French Polynesia's second largest source of commerce, falling only behind tourism. The two, however, go hand in hand. Many travellers pick some up as souvenirs of their tropical adventure, but few know how the pearls on their neck got to the display cases in the first place. (Josh Humbert/National Geographic Stock)Black Pearls, French PolynesiaThe life of a cultured Tahitian pearl starts at a pearl farm, with hundreds of these watery encampments spread across French Polynesia's many atolls. Lines of pink, white and orange buoys can be seen bobbing quietly in the surrounding waters, marking the oysters that need to be carefully tended and nurtured during the growing process. (Josh Humbert/National Geographic Stock)Black Pearls, French PolynesiaThe black-lipped oyster that produces the signature black pearl is found mainly in tropical waters, from Baja California to parts of the Indian Ocean and, most famously, French Polynesia. The oysters are left to grow naturally on lines for at least two years, at which point they become fertile and are ready to begin producing pearls. This is when divers retrieve the oysters for the next and most crucial stage of their long journey. (Aaron Huey/National Geographic Stock)Black Pearls, French PolynesiaThe young oysters are stored in saltwater until the time of grafting, when a small bead consisting of mussel shell and oyster mantle is inserted into the opened mollusc. This intricate process simulates how a pearl would organically form, when a foreign substance makes its way inside the shell and the oyster responds by secreting layers of lustrous nacre over it. The colour of the resulting pearl is determined in part by the colour of the original piece of shell that was inserted and the natural dark pigment of the black-lipped oyster. (Aaron Huey/National Geographic Stock)Black Pearls, French PolynesiaAfter the grafting is complete, the oysters are placed in nets with individual pockets and taken back underwater. This allows divers to see which molluscs have accepted the transplant and which have rejected it. Those that embrace the graft receive continued attention and care, and are brought up to the farm to be cleaned and inspected at regular intervals. Those that have refused the graft are either reseeded or discarded. The oysters remain underwater for about two years, this recovery period being vital both to the health of the oyster and the production of a quality pearl. (Aaron Huey/National Geographic Stock)Black Pearls, French PolynesiaWhen the pearl is ready to be extracted, the oyster is brought back up to the grafting lab where a technician reopens the shell and retrieves the resplendent gem. Some oysters can be re-implanted several times, as the pearl tends to grows larger with each subsequent grafting. The larger the pearl, the more expensive it will be. The largest Tahitian pearls can reach sizes of about 16mm in diameter and can cost upwards of $1,000. Travellers can buy these beauties in mounted arrangements or individually at shops, pearl showrooms or pearl farms throughout the Polynesian islands.

Once high, volcanic peaks, they have eroded completely over millennia leaving only a fringing reef around a central lagoon. Coral rubble and sand have built up in places to form motus, low, palm covered islands. The 78 Tuamotu Islands are spread across a swathe of the Pacific Ocean the size of Western Europe – with just 18,000 inhabitants. (Gabi Mocatta)lagoon, Taou, Tuamotu Islands, French PolynesiaThe island of Taou in the Tuamotu Islands has an interior lagoon that stretches 35km in length. The lagoon is accessible through several breaks in the encircling coral reef. Sea conditions in the passes can be rough, with shallow water, wind and strong tidal action combining to produce ferocious standing waves. However, the interior of the lagoon is often glassy: perfect conditions for sea kayaking. (Gabi Mocatta)Polynesian tattoos, French PolynesiaMonochrome tattoos are an eye-catching aspect of Polynesian culture. Traditionally tattoos expressed social status: higher ranks had more extensive tattooing. Banned by missionaries in the 1700s, this art form is now widespread again. Motifs like fish, sharks, turtles and rays adorn both men and women. In fact, the English word “tattoo” comes from the Tahitian tatau – a reference to the tapping of the sharp bone comb traditionally used in tattooing here. (Gabi Mocatta)Polynesian churches, Fakarava, Tuamotu Islands, French PolynesiaThe inhabitants on Fakarava in the Tuamotu Islands were evangelised by Belgian priest Honoré Laval in 1849, and the island is home to two of the oldest churches in Polynesia. Whether you are a church goer or not, one of the best ways to the experience spine-tinglingly-powerful traditional Polynesian choral singing, known as himene, is to attend a Sunday church service. (Gabi Mocatta)Anse Amiyot, Toau, Tuamotu Islands, French PolynesiaFare means “house” in Tahitian and, if you want to avoid the pricey resorts, you will likely stay in some delightfully simple guest fares, such as this one at Anse Amiyot on the island of Toau. Most are palm-thatched bungalows, some have coral gravel floors and you may find shuttered windows instead of glass. The upside: you will be steps from a crystal lagoon, eat local food with your hosts at night and experience coral island life in macro. (Gabi Mocatta)Pearl farming, French PolynesiaPearl farming is one of the mainstays of the Polynesian islands’ economies and many families have a pearl farming operation which they will invite visitors to see. Giant blacklipped oysters are seeded with a nucleus around which they secrete lustrous layers of nacre (mother of pearl), and a good sized pearl takes three to five years to grow. You can pick up a slightly irregular sample for less than $20 on the islands, but perfect pearls sell for $1,000 and more. (Gabi Mocatta)Parrot fish, French PolynesiaThese colourful reef fish have a tough, parrot-like beak to allow them to rasp algae off coral. Some species eat the coral polyps themselves, producing the sand that is an important part of the coral reef ecosystem. Snorkellers and divers in Polynesian waters will see large shoals of parrot fish, painted in a kaleidoscope of green, purple, blue and turquoise. (Gabi Mocatta)shark, Apataki, French PolynesiaThis fisherman gutting his catch on the island of Apataki gets a regular evening visit from a metre-long nurse shark.

Related article: Tahiti and French Polynesia on a budget

Celebrated as the ""island of love"" by smitten French explorers, Tahiti is the French territory's administrative and commercial backbone. Its breezy cosmopolitan capital, Papeete, sits on Tahiti's northeastern tip and is the gateway to a captivating world of indigenous culture that infuses a chain of islands spread across 5 million square kilometres of sparkling ocean between Australia and South America.
This rugged, remote land was shaped by volcanoes and many of its low-lying islands are ringed by flawless beaches and protected by coral reefs.
""Tahiti is a picture of paradise,"" said Jeremy Lefore, a French-born surf instructor. ""For me this is a spiritual adventure.""
Hurried tourists keen to experience some of French Polynesia's original soul need look no further than the burst of colour and art that illuminates Papeete every winter.
Tahiti's acclaimed cultural heart beats fastest in July during the annual dancing and sporting competition, the Heiva, when the streets of the capital bloom with dazzling costumes and the air hums with the sweetest of South Pacific songs.
Spectators are enthralled by coconut tree climbing, stone lifting, spear throwing and outrigger sailing in a Polynesian version of Scotland's Highland Games.
Tickets are often hard to come by, and, make no mistake, this is not an event driven exclusively by tourist dollars (or the Pacific Franc) but one that is committed to preserving local culture and identity, and the dancing continues with a proud energy well into the small hours, long after weary holiday makers have retreated to bed.
""It is a time for the Tahitians to really assert themselves within their normal French lifestyles,"" said Karen Stevenson, a New Zealand-based historian.
Throughout the year, most hotels have Tahitian shows and feasts of fei (cooked banana), uru (breadfruit) and poe (a fruit and tapioca dessert served with coconut milk) at least once a week. The Radisson Plaza Tahiti runs classes for visitors who are keen to delve into the mysteries of indigenous dance. The Tiki Village on Moorea, a ferry ride from Papeete, also offers a glimpse into the tribal customs of the past, along with fire dancing and delicacies from an earth oven.
Every October attention turns to the sea during the Hawaiki Nui Va'a, an outrigger canoe race that attracts more than 100 teams which navigate around the Society Islands between Huahine, Raiatea, Taha'a and Bora Bora. This is the way early Polynesians first conquered this seemingly endless world of water that is punctuated by lumps of volcanic rock and coral. While anthropological opinion varies, it is thought that settlers from Southeast Asia arrived in the Marquesas Islands around 300 AD, although other historical evidence has suggested tribes from Samoa and Tonga sailed into the region before 100 AD.
The same vast ocean eventually brought Europeans to this glittering archipelago, among them the English navigator James Cook and the French adventurer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, who arrived in the late 1760s. It is widely thought that the unruffled pace of life in Tahiti prompted sailors on the British Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty to mutiny against their commanding officer, William Bligh, who was accused of mistreating his crew, in April 1789.
Missionaries from London began their work on the islands a decade or so later, and Christianity has very strong roots in this devout corner of the South Pacific. A special treat is the spectacle of a packed service at the renovated Protestant Cathedral in Papeete, where women in their floral Sunday best fill the chamber with enchanting South Pacific hymns.
For a taste of more ancient beliefs, any itinerary should include a marae, or Polynesian temple. Most are now ruins, and while some are more preserved than others, they all harbour secrets of the past. Legends of human sacrifice tell how the body of the condemned had to be dragged across the sacred stones until blood was coated on each one. Marae Taputapuatea is a large temple complex that sits on the southeastern coast of the island of Raiatea, which was once considered to be the spiritual heart of Eastern Polynesia.
""It is where the tribes would go to see the gods and make sacrifices. Apart from being very beautiful places, you go there and really feel the power and the mythical atmosphere that there is in those ancient places,"" said Gina Bunton from Tahiti Tourism. ""Obviously we don't walk round wearing grass skirts anymore but it doesn't mean we have lost our culture.  We've managed to incorporate European ways and keep the Polynesian (traditions) as well. That makes a good mix.""

MenuLoadingTahiti and French Polynesia on a budgetShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on LinkedinBy Jean-Bernard Carillet30th March 2011Despite a reputation for opulence and exclusivity, it is perfectly possible to visit these dreamy islands on a limited budget – if you make the right decisions.TThere is no need to remortgage the house to visit Tahiti and French Polynesia.

Despite a reputation for opulence and exclusivity, it is perfectly possible to visit these dreamy islands on a limited budget - if you make the right decisions.
Affordable accommodation Glossy brochures focus on ultra-swish resorts, but French Polynesia actually has a pretty wide range of accommodation options. You can keep lodging costs down by staying in small guesthouses and pensions (homestays) that are sprinkled around the islands. They are nothing glam or ostentatious, just modest operations that blend perfectly into the tropical surroundings. At the cheaper end of the scale (around $80 per room), they consist of simple, local-style bungalows with cold showers and thin walls. Upmarket versions (plan on $100 to $120) have lots of amenities and are more comfortable.
These options also generally offer good opportunities for cultural immersion. They are mostly family-run operations (which ensures your money goes straight into local pockets) and provide much more personal, idiosyncratic experiences than hotels - the perfect island experience.
Most pensions are in scenic locations, tucked away in greenery-cloaked hills or near the ocean. In the Tuamotu archipelago, they feature a fabulous lagoon frontage - at $90 per room, how does a bungalow facing the turquoise waters of the lagoon sound?
Good news, too, for those who want to spend their holiday under canvas: French Polynesia has a smattering of camping options around. Do not expect full-blown camp sites, though; generally it is a matter of guesthouses having areas where you can pitch your tent and allowing use of the facilities. The price? Around $15 per person.
Choosing the best-value islands As much as Paris does not represent France, Bora Bora, Tahiti and Moorea (the beloved islands of tour operators), do not sum up French Polynesia. There are about 30 islands (scattered in five archipelagos) that have tourist facilities, which means that you have  plenty of choice. Tip: skip the heavily-publicised islands, such as Bora Bora, which are very expensive, and consider lesser-known, off-the-radar islands, which offer greater value for money. A few suggestions: Maupiti (Bora Bora's little sister), Raiatea, Tahaa (in the Society islands), Mataiva, Tikehau (in the Tuamotus), Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka, Ua Pou (in the Marquesas), Raivavae and Rurutu (in the Australs).
How to eat cheaply It is possible to eat reasonably by patronising snack stands and getting takeaway meals like sandwiches, salads, grilled fish and meat or fish burgers. Most pensions offer half board (bed, breakfast and one other meal) for around $20 to $30 per person (set menu) if you reserve in advance (usually the day before). This is a fantastic way to meet locals and sample the local cuisine at economical prices.
Self-catering can also save you a lot of money; many pensions have well-equipped kitchens. Fresh fish, fruits and vegetables are easily found at roadside stalls found on most major islands.
Budget-friendly ways to get around Air Tahiti, the domestic airline, has six island-hopping air passes offerings inclusive fares to a number of islands. Thus, you will save about 30% on regular flights. If you are looking for adventure and have plenty of time on your hands, boat travel works even cheaper. Cargo vessels serve most islands on a regular basis, especially within the Society group and the Tuamotus.
Hiring a car is expensive but it is possible to get around by bike on many islands; distances are rarely great, the traffic is rarely heavy and the roads are rarely hilly. Bikes can be rented for less than $15 per day.
Picking the right season It helps to travel off-season: prices are generally discounted and there is more chance of being able to bargain. Flights are full to bursting in July and August and prices skyrocket accordingly. The Christmas to New Year period is also particularly busy. The best deals can be found during the shoulder seasons - April to June and September to November.

MenuLoadingDiscoveryAn ancient ‘lost city’ teeming with lifeShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: ORLANDO SIERRA/AFP/Getty Images)By Elizabeth Pustinger5th June 2020After archaeologists discovered an ancient city deep in the Central American rainforest, researchers found something else: it’s home to animals long presumed to be extinct.LLocated in the eastern-most corner of Honduras and the northern tip of Nicaragua, the dense tropical forest of La Mosquitia is one of the largest rainforests in Central America and – until recently – one of the last scientifically explored places on Earth. In 2013, archaeologists using LIDAR (light detection and ranging) mapping technology unearthed the remains of an ancient, “lost city” buried within its depths.Ever since, researchers have been studying this dense jungle, looking not only for more of the ancient Mesoamerican city’s remains, but also scouring its untouched terrain in search of wildlife. What they recently found was greater than they had anticipated: a rich ecosystem teeming with hundreds of species of fauna and flora – some of which had been previously believed to be extinct.In 2017, led by Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program in a partnership with the Government of Honduras, a team of biologists spent two weeks in the jungle researching and cataloguing the many rare and endangered species that have found the watershed of the River Plátano, which runs through the rainforest, to be the perfect environment to thrive in. Findings in La Mosquitia include 22 species of plants and animals that had never been recorded in Honduras before and three species of animals that were thought to have vanished from the country: the pale-faced bat, the false tree coral snake and a tiger beetle that had only been seen in Nicaragua and was presumed to be extinct.In total, researchers documented hundreds of species of plants, butterflies and moths, birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish and mammals – with a great presence of cats, such as jaguars, pumas, ocelots, jaguarundis and margays – living in the rainforest.The main explanation for such diversity is that the area remained practically untouched by humans for centuries after the ancestors of indigenous communities who now live in the region inexplicably left the ancient city that once stood there.The 865,000-acre forest is mostly covered by dense 25- to 35m-tall trees, with some even reaching 50m, and as such, it isn’t easily accessible. Researchers had to be flown in by helicopters and be protected by armed soldiers; the foliage is so thick they had to hack their way through with machetes. The area also comprises the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve, the largest protected area in Honduras and a Unesco World Heritage site.In addition to housing so much wildlife, La Mosquitia is also an important greenhouse gas-emissions absorbent. However, the region has been threatened by animal trafficking and deforestation – 90% of the damage in the rainforest is caused by illegal cattle ranching, which is also heavily driven by drug trafficking in the region.In an effort to preserve the area, the rainforest is now partially guarded and patrolled by the Honduran military. In 2018, the government launched a programme to protect both the forest and the remains of the ancient city, which remained untouched and unlooted for generations – something uncommon for any historical site in Central America.(Videos by Elizabeth Pustinger; text by Luana Harumi)This video is part of BBC Reel’s World of Wonder playlist.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".

MenuLoadingCulture & Identity | Cultural ActivitiesThe country that’s famous for toleranceShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: MichaelGrantTravel/Alamy)By Quinn Hargitai3rd November 2016Pope Francis has praised this little Balkan nation for its notable religious tolerance, saying it should serve as an example for the world.AAlthough this was the first time I’d met Hasib Buba, I had already heard his voice a number of times echoing through the winding streets and alleyways of Berat, a small city in south-central Albania.With neatly parted dark hair, a well-maintained beard and a slim-fitting button down, the 25-year-old religious leader explained that as muezzin, one of his duties is to deliver the adhan, the Islamic call to prayer broadcasted from the spire-like minaret, five times each day.The Islamic call to prayer is broadcast five times a day through the streets of Berat (Credit: Martin Lehmann/Alamy)He’s the very picture of a devout Muslim – but I was surprised to learn that this had not always been the case.“I was actually raised Christian,” Buba explained, “and for years I followed that path. When I was older, I got into a debate with one of my friends, who was Muslim. The debate went on for months, and in order to be better prepared for our discussions, I started reading about Islam; I learned everything I could about it.”“In the end, I won the debate, but the process led me to ask questions about my own beliefs. The answers provided by Islam made more sense to me, so I converted,” he said.Though the choice to convert may seem a surprising one to many, the reality is that Albania has long been regarded as a place of religious tolerance and harmony.The predominant religions are Islam and Christianity, with Muslims making up more than half the population. Still, there remains a common unity between the people of the country. Churches and mosques often occupy the same streets, and interfaith marriages are widely accepted within the culture. Berat is especially noteworthy, as its Onufri Museum holds the Ikona Burimi Jetëdhënës (Icon of the Life Giving Source). This 18th-century Albanian work of art depicts a Christian scene with minarets rising in the background and is lauded as a symbol of the country's famous religious harmony.It is not unusual to see churches and mosques on the same streets in Albania (Credit: Jill Conway)In a 2014 visit, Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, praised the Balkan nation for its notable religious tolerance, saying it should serve as an example for the world. During his speech in Tirana, Pope Francis praised the “peaceful coexistence” of religions in the country, adding, “this is especially the case in these times where an authentic religious spirit is being perverted by extremist groups, and where religious differences are being distorted.”Curious to know how Albania's population had remained unified, I asked Buba for his take on the subject.“Albania has always had some type of acceptance of others. If you look throughout the country’s history, you see harmony in every century. Even during the Ottoman Empire. Many people attribute it to communism, but I don’t believe that. If you look at the history before, it just doesn’t make sense.”In 2014, Pope Francis praised the country for its religious tolerance (Credit: Gent Shkullaku/Getty)Buba is referring to the period between 1944 and 1992 when Albania was under a strict communist regime begun by dictator Enver Hoxha. Over the course of the regime, Albania became a complete isolationist state with virtually no ties to the outside world. In 1967, Hoxha tightened his grip on the country even further by banning all religion, declaring Albania the world’s first atheist state. During this time, churches and mosques were seized by the military and either destroyed or turned into cinemas or dance halls. Clergy members were stripped of their titles, shamed and in some cases incarcerated.Some speculate that this violent ousting of organized religion resulted in Albanians adopting a secular mindset, and that the country is void of any religious tension because faith is not an important element of life for many today. Buba begs to differ, though, dismissing this as cynical.To illustrate how religious harmony exists in Albania, he brought up the recent example of Malbardh, a small village in northern Albania. A few years ago, the little area made headlines across the country when the local Muslim population raised funds and rebuilt the village’s lone Catholic church, which had been torn down with so many others during Hoxha's reign.Practitioners of all religions attend religious events like The Day of the Blessed Water (Credit: Gent Shkullaku/Getty) Malbardh is not the only area to have stories like this. Leskovik, a village near the Greek border, is known for its communal prayer shrine that was built from the ruins of a mosque destroyed during WWII. The ruins remained untouched during communism, but now the shrine, located at the base of the former minaret, is frequented by Muslims and Christians alike for prayer.These tales are especially pertinent today. With fears growing around extremist groups, it seems that the stake dividing faiths is only being driven deeper.“I hear all this talk of people wanting to build walls and ban believers of certain faiths from entering countries,” Buba said. “This is only going to breed hate and misunderstanding. The reason harmony exists in Albania is because we engage with one another. We debate, we discuss and we educate ourselves about those around us.”During my two years in the country, I’d witnessed what Buba spoke about firsthand. There are numerous Muslim and Christian religious events in which practitioners of both are in attendance. The Day of the Blessed Water, for instance, is a Christian holiday celebrated by participants diving into a river in search of a cross, but it is open to all and has had many Muslim winners over the years. Likewise, Buba explained that it is not uncommon for Christians to participate in feasting during the Muslim holiday of Eid, which breaks the fast of Ramadan. By engaging with one another so frequently and in such meaningful ways, Albanian Muslims and Christians have created a strong community founded upon understanding and respect.For Albanians, coexistence and harmony come naturally (Credit: MichaelGrantTravel/Alamy)It’s hard to say whether the world will take Buba and Albania’s example to heart, but there’s something to be said for the little Balkan state in which children grow up hearing both the call to prayer and the ringing of church bells from outside their windows. For them, coexistence and harmony have become as natural as breathing.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

MenuLoadingOur Unique World | ReligionThe last of the good SamaritansShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Yaacov Dagan/Alamy)By Judith Fein29th August 2018You may well be aware of the New Testament parable of the good Samaritan. But you probably don’t know that there are around 800 ancient Israelite Samaritans still living today.Our Unique WorldOur Unique World explores distinctive subcultures around the globe in celebration of what makes us different.
Check back each week in August and September to discover a new, unique world.When people call someone a ‘good Samaritan’, they may know the parable of the good Samaritan from the Gospel of Luke, where a Samaritan helped a man who was beaten, stripped of his clothes and left by the roadside to die. But they probably don’t know that there are hundreds of ancient Israelite Samaritans still living today. I was so fascinated when I heard this that I decided to find a way to meet them when I was in Israel.My first visit was at the turn of the new millennium. Although tension was high between Israelis and Palestinians, I found a tour guide who agreed to drive me from Israel to the northern West Bank and then up Mount Gerizim to the Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza. We passed modest limestone houses and arrived at the dusty main street, where the guide stopped in front of a small, two-storey museum. Inside, it was the size of a large living room, and I saw a diorama of ancient priestly garments, a sample of round matza (unleavened bread) and a genealogical tree in the shape of a menorah (seven-branched candelabrum) that went back thousands of years.One wall was covered with photographs of austere, bearded old men wearing turbans. The priest, who was the guardian of the museum, pointed to one of them and said, “That was my father, the kohen gadol, or high priest of the Samaritans. The priestly lineage goes back to Aaron, the brother of Moses.”“Moses of the Ten Commandments?” I asked. He nodded.And that’s when I lost it. I began to cry, and the tears never stopped until I left the mountaintop. I felt I had encountered something that was very ancient, powerful and true.Mount Gerizim is home to the Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza (Credit: Hanan Isachar/Alamy)You may also be interested in:• The islands with a ‘third gender’• A side of Palestine that’s rarely seen• An epic hike of biblical proportions Many visitors to the sacred Mount Gerizim are Christians, drawn by the New Testament parable and the fact that the Samaritans still speak the ancient Hebraic language that Jesus spoke. According to Biblical tradition, the Israelites were divided into 12 tribes and the Israelite Samaritans say they are descended from three of them: Menasseh, Ephraim and Levi. After the Exodus from Egypt and 40 years of wandering, Joshua led the people of Israel to Mount Gerizim. There he united the tribes with a ceremony that included a blessing for Mount Gerizim (which became known as the Mountain of the Blessing) and a curse for Mount Ebal (the Mountain of the Curse).I felt I had encountered something that was very ancient, powerful and trueI felt like I’d been catapulted back to the days of the Hebrew Bible. When I returned home to the US, I emailed Benyamim (Benny) Tsedaka, a scholar, historian and ambassador-at-large for the Israelite Samaritans. He explained that “There were two ancient kingdoms: Judea (Jews) from the south, and we were the tribes from the north. We eventually separated, but our origins are identical.” He said that in the 6th Century CE, the Israelite Samaritans numbered 1,500,000. They were persecuted and killed for practicing their ancient faith by Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Mamluks and Ottomans. By 1919, there were only 141 Samaritans left. Today they number more than 800, with half living in Holon (south of Tel Aviv) and the other half on the mountain. They’re one of the world’s oldest and smallest religious groups and their songs are among the most ancient in the world.The Samaritan community is one of the world’s oldest and smallest religious groups (Credit: Eddie Gerald/Alamy)Several years later, on my second visit to the region, I went to Holon to meet Tsedaka. Tall, grey-haired, with cocoa-coloured skin and a penchant for telling jokes, singing Shirley Bassey songs and Broadway tunes, he talked passionately about his people, called me ‘achot’ (sister) and insisted I call him ‘ach’ (brother). We walked around Holon, where about 80 Samaritan families were then living and working as lawyers, teachers, bankers and engineers.“No-one is a doctor,” Tsedaka explained, “because that would mean working on Sabbath, which is strictly forbidden.”We approached the Samaritan synagogue, a small building with a red-tile roof, limestone walls and a seven-branched candelabrum above the entry gate, inscribed with ancient Hebrew writing. Inside were piles of prayer books but no seats. Tsedaka explained that the men kneel or sit on the floor, and their Torah (holy book) has three crowns on it, which represent their three tribes of origin. Men are obliged to attend synagogue on Sabbath; for women, it’s optional.The Samaritan Torah has three crowns on it to represent their three tribes of origin (Credit: Boris Diakovsky/Alamy)On Friday afternoon, before the Sabbath, Tsedaka drove me from his house in Holon through the West Bank, arriving at his second home in Kiryat Luza without incident, even though a Palastinian uprising was roiling in the area. The Samaritans who live on their sacred mountain, between Palestinians in the West Bank and Jews in Israel, try to be a neutral bridge of peace between the two. Many Samaritans speak Arabic, have Arabic names in addition to Hebrew names, and speak both ancient and modern Hebrew; some speak English as well.Tsedaka took me to the Samaritans’ three holiest places on the mountain: where Abraham brought Isaac to be sacrificed; the 12 stones where Joshua united the tribes after the Exodus; and a large, empty slab of deep-grey stone where the Israelites erected the Tabernacle when they arrived in Israel. “This is called the Eternal Hill,” Tsedaka said. “It’s the holy of holies. I know the Jews have another version of where these events took place, but our history says they happened here.”We walked around the Mount Gerizim archaeological site which had recently opened. More than 500 ancient stone inscriptions were found here, Tsedaka told me, in addition to Persian, Hellenistic, Byzantine and Samaritan ruins and artefacts. Today the area is a national park, maintained by Israel.Mount Gerizim features prominently in the Bible, and today the area is a national park (Credit: Hanan Isachar/Alamy)As the sun lowered on the horizon, we entered Tsedaka’s house to prepare for Sabbath. Tsedaka went into his bedroom, and when he emerged, I was shocked by his transformation. He wore traditional ancient Israelite clothes: a long, white robe, tarboosh (red cylindrical hat with the white band of an elder) and sandals. We walked down the main street to the synagogue, joining other men and boys dressed like Tsedaka heading in the same direction. They left their sandals outside the sanctuary door. Inside, they sat, kneeled and stood on rugs, sometimes bowing their heads in the direction of their ancient Tabernacle. The sound of their prayers was deep and throaty. When they said the name ‘Moses’, they covered their faces with their hands as Moses did when God spoke to him.After the service, a group of men approached me at the back of the synagogue, where I was sitting on a plastic chair. They asked me a pressing question: “Do you know if Maccabee Tel Aviv won?” It was their favourite basketball team. Samaritans are not permitted to watch television or use anything electric on the Sabbath. But even on their holiest day of the week, they still wanted to know how their team had done.We get along with Palestinians and Jews, and we want to propose Mount Gerizim as an international peace centreTsedaka, like all the other men, goes to the synagogue three times on the Sabbath day, starting at 03:30. At 11:00, Tsedaka’s wife Miriam served lunch: copious amounts of salad, hummus, tahini, round matza, fried green beans, potatoes and fillet of sole. At 13:00, we headed back to the synagogue for 90 minutes of melodic prayer, and then visited several Samaritan homes, which is a custom on Sabbath. One of the community’s political leaders had a sumptuously decorated room dotted with photos of him with former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan.“We get along with Palestinians and Jews,” Tsedaka said, “and we want to propose Mount Gerizim as an international peace centre.”As the sun set, half of the men did their final prayers for Sabbath in the synagogue and the other half on the sacrificial grounds on Mount Gerizim where the startlingly gory Samaritan Passover takes place. Every year, scholars and tourists come from around the world to witness the Paschal sacrifice, which is performed as it’s described in the Book of Exodus. The High Priest examines each family’s lamb or sheep to make sure it has no blemishes. All the animals are slaughtered at once, and roasted on spits in large, sunken fire pits. It’s a bloody ritual, and participants, dressed in white, spread blood on their foreheads to stave off the angel of death. At midnight, the roasted lamb is consumed rapidly with matza and bitter herbs.Scholars and tourists come from around the world to witness the Paschal sacrifice, which is performed as it’s described in the Book of Exodus (Credit: Nir Alon/Alamy)The third time I visited, several years later, Tsedaka took me to the city of Nablus in the West Bank to visit Jacob’s Well; it’s associated with the patriarch Jacob who fathered the 12 ancient tribes of Israel, and it’s believed to be where Jesus spoke to a Samaritan woman. Today, the solid rock well is in a sunken crypt on the grounds of a Greek-Orthodox monastery, and I purchased a small ceramic souvenir bottle of well water.We stopped briefly at Joseph’s Tomb, which is also in Nablus; over the years, Muslims, Christians and Jews have contended for control of the site. Today, only a small, 19th-Century rectangular room with a cupola remains; alas, no, there’s no visible archaeological evidence of an earlier structure.“How do you like it?” Tsedaka asked.“It’s like it all stepped out of the pages of the Bible. Moses, Joshua, Jacob, Joseph, the Exodus, the 12 tribes… it’s overwhelming,” I replied.Tsedaka nodded, and grinned.The Samaritans are said to be descended from three of the 12 tribes of Israel: Menasseh, Ephraim and Levi (Credit: Yaacov Dagan/Alamy)On my last visit to Mount Gerizim in 2012, Tsedaka got permission for me to meet with the High Priest, the spiritual leader of the Israelite Samaritans who I had heard could trace his lineage back through 130 high priests to the second son of Aaron, the brother of Moses.The gate swung open and I was cordially ushered inside to an ornate living room. Within minutes, the white-bearded High Priest entered, wearing a grey robe and red turban. A dignified man in his early 80s, he was accompanied by his deputy High Priest and members of his family. He motioned for me to sit next to him on a sofa. The audience had begun. ""What can I do for you?"" he asked with genteel formality.The meeting was very friendly, until I mentioned that I had once eaten camel. The High Priest grew ashen and his family looked away, as though embarrassed.""Eating camel is worse than eating pig!"" he bellowed.He said I had to atone and do penance. I swore I’d never eat camel again. The meeting was clearly over. Completely deflated, I began skulking out of the room in shame. The High Priest burst out laughing. ""It's been enjoyable meeting… a camel-eater,” he said.Tsedaka later told me that after I left, the High Priest asked if the camel-eater had got home safely.Today, the Samaritans who live on Mount Gerizim try to be a neutral bridge of peace between the Palestinians and the Jews (Credit: Boris Diakovsky/Alamy)It was the second time I realised that Samaritans have one foot in orthodoxy and serious tradition, and another in a world of humour – and a friendly acceptance of visitors who come to learn about them.Our Unique World is a BBC Travel series that celebrates what makes us different and distinctive by exploring offbeat subcultures and obscure communities around the globe.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

MenuLoadingAdventure & Experience | National ParksThe Israeli park with a valuable secretShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Sara Toth Stub)By Sara Toth Stub20th April 2018Many people visit Israel’s Timna National Park to admire its rock formations, but the full story of this place can only be experienced by heading underground.IIn Israel’s Negev Desert, a side road leads to a valley ringed by red, purple and brown cliffs. Now part of Timna National Park, this valley is famous for its jagged landscape carved by wind and water over many millennia. Tourists and geologists alike come here to admire rock formations shaped like giant mushrooms, elegant pillars and delicate arches.It was mid-morning when I set off on a short hike, and the sun was already blazing hot. From a trailhead near the park’s famous coral-coloured rock formation known as the Arches, I ascended a small hill and within 10 minutes stood atop a plateau. From up here I could see the valley’s rugged terrain, with cliffs above and canyons below.As amazing as the scenery was, the full story of this place – and the reason why people flocked to this harsh landscape in prehistoric times – can only be experienced by heading underground.Timna National Park in Israel is famous for its jagged landscape and rock formations (Credit: Sara Toth Stub)You may also be interested in:• Buenos Aires’ mysterious secret tunnels• An ancient world concealed underground• The sinful city swallowed by the EarthTimna National Park was once one of the centres of metal production in the ancient world; here, thousands of mining shafts and tunnels were painstakingly bored to harvest the copper embedded in the stone.Specks of green and blue copper ore dotted the gravel-covered trail as I approached the park’s oldest mines, dug as early as 4500BC. Metal handrails help visitors navigate a few metres down a steep slope to enter the mine, a narrow passageway with ceilings so low I had to crawl on my hands and knees to avoid hitting my head. Beams of light shone into the tunnel from openings that have emerged over the years from erosion, exposing the vertical scores on the walls left by the stone tools used to carve the cavity into the Earth.You can touch things left at Timna 3,000 and 4,000 years ago“[Miners] worked in very harsh conditions in the desert, a place without water and really without anything,” said Dr Erez Ben-Yosef, professor of archaeology at Tel Aviv University and director of the Central Timna Valley Project, an interdisciplinary research project about the region’s history of copper production.This mine, and the others in the area, follow the horizontal turquoise veins of copper that snake through the ground south of the Dead Sea in both Israel and Jordan. Thousands of years ago, miners chiselled out this copper ore, carried it out of the mines, then heated it to extract a shiny metal that was used to make beads, pendants and other decorative items. It was among the earliest examples of people deriving metal from stone, Dr Ben-Yosef said, and thanks to the dry climate, Timna’s are among the world’s best-preserved ancient mines.“You can see everything. You can touch things left at Timna 3,000 and 4,000 years ago,” he added.The oldest copper mines in Timna National Park date back to 4500BC (Credit: Sara Toth Stub)Aside from mines like this, some flint tools and heaps of rock left from the smelting process, these early miners didn’t leave much behind. “We know very little about these first miners,” Dr Ben-Yosef said. “We don’t have names for them. We just know that they were local people working with very simple stone tools.”The caverns and shafts throughout Timna National Park reveal thousands of years of mining history. Evidence has been found linking these mines to Ancient Egypt’s New Kingdom, which existed from the 16th through the early 11th Centuries BC. Copper from here enriched the series of Ramses pharaohs who used it for everything from weapons to jewellery. However, further evidence shows that mining here reached its peak several hundred years later. High-resolution radiocarbon dating of seeds and other organic matter left in the miners’ work camps indicates the mines were active between the 11th and 9th Centuries BC, lending credence to theories that Timna was the source of copper for the biblical King Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem.And until recently, experts assumed the gruelling manual labour had been done by slaves. But archaeological findings over the last few years, including high-quality dyed fabrics preserved by the dry climate, indicate that the metalworkers were employed rather than enslaved. Remains of sheep and goat bones as well as date and olive pits also suggest that the workers ate a rich diet of foods not usually found in the desert.Writing and other marks left behind by ancient miners are still visible on the rock walls (Credit: Sara Toth Stub)By this time, people had learned how to shape the copper found in Timna’s mines into tools and weapons, and how to mix it with tin to create bronze, a much stronger material. Evidence of this early metalworking is on display in museums around the world. Tel Aviv’s Eretz Israel Museum has the largest collection of artefacts from Timna, including copper chisels used for mining and a bronze serpent found in a local temple.“When you see the things they made, then you understand why all this work in the mines was worth it,” Dr Ben Yosef said.The mines can be accessed during the park’s opening hours without a guide or any previous arrangements. While the cavern offered a cool respite from the heat, I was a relieved to reach the end. Climbing the ladder back to the desert’s scorched surface, it felt good to stand up straight again.Over the course of several centuries, thousands of mines and tunnels were dug beneath what is now Timna National Park (Credit: Sara Toth Stub)I continued on the trail to peer down a nearly 3,000-year-old precipice-like mine shaft, catching a glimpse of the niches scored by miners as they climbed in and out. A little way further along a dry desert streambed, entrances to dozens of mines looked like turquoise-striped pockmarks along the rocky walls. All around me, colourful ridges rose several storeys as if reaching for the fiery desert sun. The landscape was breathtaking, to say the least, but not nearly as fascinating as what some of the world’s earliest miners had left behind.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

Other years, just a band of it appears,” she said. This particular band, she added, measured about 60cm wide and spanned the entire length of the beach, and was one of the largest she had ever seen.You may also be interested in: • A Swiss village lost in Canada • A tempestuous isle of 1,000 shipwrecks  • The world's toughest highwayFor 25 years, LaFaver has lived in the tiny resort village of Candle Lake, a community of 850 full-time residents that falls within the provincial park boundary lines. She’s seen how the hue and length of the coloured sand fluctuates with the currents and the seasons. So, on that afternoon, knowing that next year it may not appear in the same illuminating fashion, or at all, LaFaver and her family seized their opportunity.“We got off the boat and hung out there the whole day,” she said. “I didn’t know when I would get to see it that distinct along the whole shore [again].”Known simply as “Purple Sands Beach”, this secluded expanse of land has earned a reputation around Canada for its awe-inspiring geological feature. The grains of sand can appear in a spectrum of chromatic hues, ranging from lavender to magenta and sometimes even pink. Vivid particles can appear smeared down the shore like an artist’s brushstroke, scattered in clusters across rocks and rippled beneath the water’s surface in the lake’s shallow bays.The hue and amount of coloured sand fluctuates with the currents and the seasons (Credit: Stephanie Groat)Seeing this natural phenomenon in person has become a pilgrimage for naturalists, geological fanatics and out-of-town visitors, who arrive year-round with hopes of catching a glimpse before it's washed away or disappears underneath snowfall.“Well, you don’t think it’s real,” said Debbie Hunter, 64, a Candle Lake local who lives near Minowukaw Beach, one of the park’s designated campgrounds.It’s hard to believe that there’s purple sand. It’s just – it’s bizarre, really.After a strong windstorm or an occurrence of large wave breaks, Hunter has seen traces of the purple sand displaced all around this landscape that shares a border with provincial forestland. Some residents have even reported seeing the coloured grains along the shores of Torch Lake, a smaller body of water that feeds into Candle Lake, but not in the same copious amount or vibrancy.Wherever it is, Hunter said, “it’s hard to believe that there’s purple sand. It’s just – it’s bizarre, really.”While the imagery of purple sand may appear like something from a fairy tale, there is a geological explanation behind it. According to Kevin Ansdell, professor of geology at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, all beaches attribute their colouring to the minerals, rocks and shells that comprise their various sand particles.The most common component of sand is silicon dioxide in the form of quartz (Credit: Ryan McDonald)“If you go around the world, there’s all sorts of different coloured beaches,” explained Ansdell, whose work includes public outreach and education about the diversity of geological landscapes within Saskatchewan. “Obviously, the most common are the typical white sands that you think about. Those are typically made of lots of rounded grains of quartz.”As the second-most common mineral found on Earth, quartz is the reason why so many shorelines have white sand, he said.However, white is not the only hue to decorate a coastline. Iceland and Hawaii, for example, each have a collection of black-sand beaches, which owe their dark and moody tones to volcanic lava rock. And there are other examples around the world where minerals and sediment have transformed bodies of water into surreal-looking landscapes. Peyto Lake in Banff National Park in Alberta owes its turquoise colour to glacial sediments suspended in its water; while the Yellow River in western China, which originates in the province of Qinghai, has accumulated so much silt and sediment that the river remains a constant shade of blonde.The environment of northern Saskatchewan, however, owes its colouring to a mineral that has been discovered all around the world but is found in large quantities across northern Canada. “With the purple-sand beaches, of which Candle Lake is one example,” Ansdell said, “the most likely mineral is the mineral called garnet.”Purple Sands Beach owes its colouring to the mineral garnet, which is found inside rocks that date back more than a billion years (Credit: Scott Shillington)For thousands of years, this colourful and resistant mineral, one that comes in a variety of shades but which is mostly seen as dark red, has been discovered in rocks across the Canadian Shield, a large section of the North American continent that encompasses a majority of the northern half of Canada. This mineral-rich landmass extends from Labrador in the east to Manitoba in the west and all the way north into the Northwest Territories, including most of northern Saskatchewan. Because of this landscape’s vast size and ancient history, the resources found in the Canadian Shield have become valuable components of the nation’s economy.“In the Canadian Shield overall, there’s lots of different mineral deposits,” said Ansdell, of the gold, copper, nickel and even diamonds that are often uncovered, in addition to minerals like garnet.Found inside rocks that date back more than a billion years, garnet is created during metamorphism, a chemical and mineralogical process that happens when rocks become buried deep inside the Earth’s crust as its tectonic plates shift. Through various processes, these rocks change their internal compositions to adjust to higher pressures and temperatures, Ansdell explained.“Obviously if you’ve got garnet in the sands, the garnet must have come from somewhere,” he said. “It’s almost certainly the metamorphosed rocks in northern Saskatchewan.”Garnet was carried south from the Canadian Shield by glacial activity during the most recent Ice Age and deposited on the lake shore  (Credit: Leanne Summers)These rocks were then transported across the province during the most recent Ice Age, which ended approximately 12,000 years ago, when large sheets of ice slid across exposed sections of the Canadian Shield, scattering their contents in places like Candle Lake. Over time, the rocks were broken down and carried downstream by fresh water sources, reworked by the currents and eventually collected in one place, said Ansdell.While the residents of Candle Lake may not know all the scientific details about how its most famous beach receives its alluring sparkle, they do remember how it felt when they saw it for the first time.“I was a just kid, probably just 14,” recalled Hunter, about her first encounter with the purple sand more than 50 years ago. Hunter grew up in the nearby city of Prince Albert and began visiting the lake before there was a paved highway. “If you had rain or any miserable weather… yikes,” she joked, about making the 80km journey to visit her husband’s family who owned a cabin in the Candle Lake community.It’s a small-knit community and they seem to look out after each otherBack then, mostly avid fisherman and hunters were drawn to the lake’s clear water that is home to many fish species, including the walleye, pike, perch, burbot, whitefish and sucker, and its abundant wildlife, like elk, bear, wolves and deer. After a new highway was constructed in the mid-1970s, which connected this distant village to the rest of the province, word spread and Candle Lake quickly became a year-round destination.In 1986, the government of Canada established it as a provincial park, to “protect the fringe of the northern forest and to offer a variety of recreational opportunities in all seasons.”During winter, Candle Lake freezes over and turns into a barren ice field (Credit: Ryan McDonald)Like many environments in the upper reaches of the northern hemisphere, Candle Lake is one of extremes. During the winter months, its glassy surface transforms into a barren ice field. Pickup trucks and ice shacks dot the horizon and provide shelter for the brave fishermen who, even when temperatures drop to -30C, drill holes into this dense, icy covering to catch their dinner. Locals stay active by playing in the town’s curling league and shovel snow for their neighbours who may need extra help, said Hunter, who serves as a volunteer fire fighter and first responder.“The people are so friendly,” she said. “It’s a small-knit community and they seem to look out after each other.”By late April, longer days and warmer temperatures help the lake thaw out, and by July, families start to arrive by the carload to celebrate Canada Day, the busiest time of year, when close to 15,000 visitors pack the shoreline to celebrate the national holiday.No matter what time of the year it is, Purple Sands Beach and the beauty of this rugged landscape attracts people from around the world, and some of its biggest admirers plan to stay for a while.“I’ve done a lot of travelling, but work has kept me here and I’m very content with that,” said LaFaver. “[Candle Lake] is a beautiful place to work and live.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story referred to tides impacting the hue and amount of purple sand. However, since there will not be observable tides on a lake of this size, the story has been updated to use the proper term of currents.   Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".

MenuLoadingAdventure & Experience | Remote PlacesTuktoyaktuk: Canada’s last Arctic village?Share using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Mike MacEacheran)By Mike MacEacheran19th April 2018Canada’s 137km Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway is a vital new lifeline across unremittingly spartan tundra, but also a window on an almost-forgotten way of indigenous life.OOne million antlers were set against the northern sky. Or so it looked from the vantage point of the revving snowmobile as it lurched across the tundra basin. Around 3,000 wild reindeer had bunched together on the horizon, their branched horns seamlessly melding with an endless swathe of skeletal willow and black spruce. We were 60km south of the Arctic Ocean in the remote northern reaches of Canada’s Northwest Territories, and left to Mother Nature it was a spectacle unaffected by man for millennia.Two bushy foxes bounded across the permafrost, scattering the herd downhill past shoreline lichen onto a frozen lake ahead. The hush of the Arctic winter broken, the herd became a flurry of tawny hides and hooves.That’s the sound of the tundra“Listen,” said Inuvialuit (Western Canadian Inuit) guide Noel Cockney softly, as he stopped his Ski-Doo and gestured across the ice. It was -25C and his voice barely pierced his thick protective face mask. “When the reindeer run, it sounds like rain on snow. That’s the sound of the tundra.” Hidden deep at the top of the country’s largely unexplored Arctic perimeter, Canada’s largest reindeer herd have long lived in solitude. Every spring, the scruffy animals migrate west to their calving grounds on nearby Richards Island to rear their young, but these days they have more to contend with than just wily foxes and wolf packs.They now have to deal with the arrival of man.The remote northern reaches of the Northwest Territories is home to Canada’s largest reindeer herd (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)You may also be interested in:• The people who want to buy a railroad• An ice road mapped by dog sled• Norway’s icy marvel of engineeringFor the last two millennia, the only people who have been able to understand and adapt to this land are the Inuvialuit, the custodians of the north who live in settlements across the Mackenzie Delta, where Canada’s longest river system empties into the Arctic Ocean. Numbering around 5,700, the Inuvialuit have maintained a lifestyle as traditional as it gets in the Americas. In step with the seasons, they are bound to the land, trapping Arctic hare, fox and lynx for meat and fur in the colder months; in summer they harvest beluga whales during sanctioned hunts along the Tuktoyaktuk coast to provide the sustenance they need to get through the long winter.The opening of the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway in November 2017 has changed everything for this frozen wilderness. Built at a cost of CAD$300 million and nicknamed the Arctic Ice Road, the 137km-long, two-lane gravel highway is the first all-weather road to Canada’s Arctic Coast, cleaving this isolated tract of tundra in two.The highway could also be described as the world’s toughest. Taking four years to build – three to create a thick-enough layer of hard-packed gravel to withstand the harsh winters, and one to refine the surface – it’s been designed to tolerate temperatures that can tip below -40C as well as hit 20C on summer nights when the sun never sets.The opening of the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway has changed everything for this frozen wilderness (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)And yet even though this is a lifeline for the remote indigenous Inuvialuit community of Tuktoyaktuk (population: 850), the last Arctic village on the edge of mainland Canada’s frozen wilderness, the road is proving divisive. Conceived as a path to oil and gas exploration by former prime minister Stephen Harper’s administration, some see it as a road to resources (despite a temporary moratorium on offshore licences from Justin Trudeau’s government). Others call it a vanity project, bringing this fragile community one step closer to cultural erosion.But for its ardent supporters, including Tuktoyaktuk local Noel Cockney who spent two years working on the road, the highway marks a rebirth for this ultra-remote community. Opening the outpost year round to visitors for the first time ever, it is an opportunity for progress and possibility. In summer, drivers can now reach otherwise inaccessible lakes and rivers, many of which have never been explored. In winter, there is the visceral thrill of witnessing the reindeer herd and driving to out-of-touch Tuktoyaktuk, whose name means ‘looks like a caribou’ in the local language. And for locals, the new route is a potential honeypot for attracting investment and jobs.Local Noel Cockney spent two years working on the road (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)Prior to the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway, the community’s winter connection to the outside world was a rudimentary and ephemeral ice track that melted every spring.“Getting to ‘Tuk’ used to be incredibly difficult,” said Cockney, parking his snowmobile at a viewpoint overlooking the new highway. “In winter, our way out vanished into thin air, and in summer it was a choice of two: fly or take a boat along the river.” Now, since the road’s arrival, local carrier Aklak Air has suspended its daily service.The value of keeping these cultural traditions alive can’t be underestimatedAnother individual embracing the road’s opportunity is Kylik Kisoun Taylor, a second-generation Inuvialuit who represents the vanguard of the next generation of northerners. A board member of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada and owner of Tundra North Tours, an Inuit company based in the village of Inuvik at the southernmost point of the road, Taylor grew up in southern Ontario but felt the call of the north from the moment he returned at age 16.“Indigenous culture is a resource here and tourism has the power to harness it,” he told me, clad in seal fur, as we pulled out of Inuvik while driving the new road north. “Whether it’s trapping a duck or killing a caribou with a spear – the value of keeping these cultural traditions alive can’t be underestimated. Indigenous communities are forgetting how to use these Arctic skills, but they can be compatible with tourism and the modern world. And I want to educate visitors about this.”The indigenous Inuvialuit community of Tuktoyaktuk is the last Arctic village on the edge of mainland Canada’s frozen wilderness (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)For all that the highway divides local opinion, to drive it is mesmerising. Far from an arrow-straight highway, it loops and bends, hugging the north’s frozen ponds, the so-called Eskimo Lakes, a system of brackish estuarine basins. At the roadside, the Richardson Mountains and boreal forest fade until they disappear completely, leaving the windshield crowded with nothing but a panorama of bald ice. And there are so many shades of white, the sky takes on a pale-coloured glow.“You haven’t seen the Arctic unless you come in winter,” said Taylor as we passed a huge plateau of ice. Up close, wind-blown snow rushed the road, moving gravel like an illusion. “We’re at the edge of the tree line here – this is the limit of where it’s comfortable to live.”Past a series of pingos, periglacial landforms made of earth-covered ice that are Canadian national landmarks, Tuktoyaktuk began to make its presence felt. As if divorced from its own country, the village sits segregated on a spit of land jutting out into the Arctic Ocean. There are no sugar maple or spruce, or any trees for that matter – only endless ocean, the cold grey waves frozen and paused.The Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway took four years and cost CAD$300 million to build (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)(Credit: Mike MacEacheran)Before the highway, the Inuvialuit’s winter connection to the outside world was a rudimentary ice track that melted every spring (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)(Credit: Mike MacEacheran)The highway opens Tuktoyaktuk year round to visitors, providing an opportunity for progress and possibility (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)(Credit: Mike MacEacheran)Kylik Kisoun Taylor: “Indigenous culture is a resource here and tourism has the power to harness it” (Credit: Mike MacEacheran)(Credit: Mike MacEacheran)Two and a half hours after setting off, we finally parked near a pier entombed in ice. Tuktoyaktuk’s streets were empty from the cold. The husky huts, where sled dog teams bedded down, were shut for the night. No-one was around except at the Tuktu B&B, where I met owner Maureen Pokiak, who discussed the road’s impact with me over dinner. Her husband, James, she apologised, was out on an overnight musk ox hunt.The road may make life a lot easier for folk in the longer term, but we’ll remain connected to the land“This community is in our blood, so I don’t anticipate too many changes,” she said, while sharpening a traditional ulu knife to prepare a customary indigenous meal – raw beluga whale, or muktuk. “There’s a hardcore element who love the extremes of this environment, and they live and breathe tradition. The road may make life a lot easier for folk in the longer term, but we’ll remain connected to the land – that’s the way it’ll always be.”Only when our truck headed back south to Inuvik in the darkness, the street lights diffusing a glow across the snow, did I start to understand what she meant. As the road crossed a series of humpback hills, the Arctic sun rose to reveal the ever-shifting beauty of the tundra, the epic drama of the landscape lit in an all-encompassing brilliant silver on white. Out in the pre-dawn light, the reindeer herd were moving on, the sound of ‘rain’ on snow a signal that life in the tundra will go on. Just as it has always done.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""If You Only Read 6 Things This Week"".

MenuLoadingAdventure & Experience | HistoryThe birthplace of Canada’s mountain cultureShare using EmailShare on TwitterShare on FacebookShare on Linkedin(Image credit: Parks Canada/I Houghton)By Cassidy Randall22nd January 2020The gritty railroad town of Golden is home to the origin story of Western Canada’s celebrated mountain culture, which has lured countless adventurers for more than a century.CCanada’s gritty railroad town of Golden, BC, doesn’t boast the historical grandeur of Banff just to the east nor the new resort skiing hype of Revelstoke over the Continental Divide to the west. But it has its own unique claim to fame: it’s the gateway to Rogers Pass, home to some of the best backcountry skiing in Canada, which is why I was here with my crew of skiers to access big mountain-style alpine lines in the Selkirk range. And it’s also home to the origin story of Western Canada’s celebrated mountain culture, which has drawn in countless mountaineers, climbers and skiers just like us for more than a century.As we pulled out of town to head west on the Trans-Canada Highway and wound up towards the summit of the pass, I glanced to the right, my attention caught by what looked to be a European chalet almost completely hidden in trees on the steep hillside. Its antique gingerbread facade, with steeply gabled, narrow two-storey roofs and ornate framework hanging from the eves, seemed anachronous in this blue-collar town dominated by rail and sawmill, where nearly all historic buildings were consumed in a fierce fire in 1926.The Swiss guides established nearly all the first ascents of the peaks around Rogers Pass (Credit: twigymuleford/Getty Images)That curious house is one of eight that make up a little village called Edelweiss. In this nearly forgotten cluster of homes, on the fringe of this low-profile town, lived a group of Swiss guides who left an indelible mark on this part of the world. They put up numerous first ascents in Rogers Pass and around Banff and Lake Louise and unlocked these peaks for a new wave of adventurers looking for unclimbed mountains after Europe’s had been conquered. And they laid the foundation for skiing as the winter obsession it is today in this region.The chalet disappeared from the rear-view mirror as we drove up the highway that parallels the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) track, and it was immediately apparent why this formidable spine of untouched mountains presented CPR’s final hurdle in connecting the east and west of the country. Where progress had been swift from the coast and across the prairies, the seemingly impenetrable Selkirk Mountains between Golden and Revelstoke slowed building while surveyors searched for a pass and engineered the rail over its sharp landscape. In fact, the grade is so steep here that, due to the limitations in train locomotion in the late 1800s, it wasn’t feasible to haul dining cars – which had become a popular feature of rail travel – up the pass for the long journey between Banff and Golden to Revelstoke and onto Vancouver.The Canadian Pacific Railway connected the east and west of the country, passing through popular tourist destinations such as Banff (Credit: MJ_Prototype/Getty Images)As a solution, CPR built Glacier House, an alpine chalet close to the summit of the pass, where passengers could get off the train for meals and stay overnight if they chose. This was the latest iteration in CPR president William Van Horne’s vision of the railway as a vehicle to bring wealthy tourists to experience the romantic lifestyle of the mountains. CPR had already played a significant role in the development of Glacier and Yoho National Parks, and built grand hotels in Banff and Lake Louise. But, concerned that guests would wander off and become lost (or worse) in these serrated peaks and crevassed glaciers so close to Glacier House – and the negative press that might ensure – CPR hired Swiss mountain guides, known as the best in the world for their depth of skill and breadth of knowledge, to stay at the chalet and guide its guests through these undiscovered mountains. This move was the advent of adventure tourism in Western Canada.You may also be interested in: • The unlikely home of the world's smallest desert • Canada's last Arctic village? • The little-known Canada-US border warFirst up were Edouard Feuz Sr and Christian Haesler, brought by CPR from Interlaken in 1899. Seven more guides joined them, including Edouard’s brothers Walter and Ernest, who initially came to Canada each spring and returned to Switzerland in October. Each season, CPR worried that the guides, whom the railway relied on to help lure tourists, might not come back to Canada. So they built Edelweiss in 1912 for the guides to bring their families and stay permanently in the country.A hand-painted postcard of Glacier House circa 1910 (Credit: Revelstoke Museum & Archives)The Swiss Village became a tourist attraction of its own, with a Disneyland-like sign at the base of the hill, visible from the passing train, announcing the presence of mountaineering greatness and the potential for hopeful climbers to leverage such accomplished guidance. The Swiss guides became well-known for guiding many tourists, aspiring climbers and serious climbers in the Selkirks. As much as CPR’s original mission was to provide the first transportation route to connect the young country, CPR’s marketing mission was to sell this part of Canada as unblemished country ripe for the adventurous to explore – and the Swiss guides were the lynchpin in this strategy. As Arthur Wheeler wrote in the Canadian Alpine Journal in 1928, “The coming of the Swiss guides created a new era. Climbing became more general, and not confined only to mountaineers of repute in alpine circles and mountain clubs.”Parking at the highway’s zenith, we headed into the Rogers Pass Discovery Center, where staff directed us to the Swiss Guides room to don ski boots, examine maps and routes and read the avalanche report. It was like walking back in time. Glacier House no longer exists – pieces of its foundation still remain down by the Illecillewaet Campground in a ghost of its former glory – but a glimpse of its grand heyday has been preserved in antiques, recovered from the chalet, here in this room. Among the plush chairs, stone fireplace fronts, gold mantles and timber bar, with the sawtooth massif of the Hermit and Tupper mountains rising out the window, it was easy to imagine the train pulling up to Glacier Station and seeing Ernest Feuz brandishing climbing gear, waving from his post on the platform in what became a familiar sight for travellers on the CPR.Edward Feuz Jr worked with his father and brothers guiding CPR guests through the mountains (Credit: Golden Museum)Old signs from the chalet hung from the post across the timber bar. One advertised “The Challenge of the Mountains”, complete with rentals of ponies and divided skirts for women to ride them. The journeys on offer from Glacier House for adventure seekers – Great Glacier for $1, Asulkan Glacier for $2, Baloo Pass via Cougar Valley for $5 – echoed some of the routes on our Rogers Pass ski touring maps. But it was the text at the bottom of this sign that caught my eye: “Swiss Guides are stationed at the hotel and are available for the service of tourists for the fee of $5 per day. The guides provide rope, ice axes, etc and visitors intending to climb should be equipped with stout boots, well-nailed.”The Swiss guides, renowned for their training in snow, rock, ice, weather, maps and first aid and rescue, established nearly all the first ascents of the peaks that we were now skiing among: Uto, Mt Sir Donald, Eagle, Avalanche, McGill, Ursus, MacDonald, Tupper and many more. They scoped and climbed each route, as well as trails and campsites on the way in, before guiding clients on it – but then offered the claim of first ascent to their guests in the humble tradition of mountain guiding.It seems almost incredible that he is in mountain climbing circles a world-famous personEach guide notched more than 20 true first ascents to his name, though, with Ernest achieving a stunning 102. Upon Ernest’s death in 1952, then a fixture in the Golden community, as were the rest of the guides and their families, the local newspaper, Golden Star, called him a shockingly humble expert among experts: “Knowing Ernest as we do, as a very modest man, it seems almost incredible that he is in mountain climbing circles a world-famous person.”The Golden Museum features the history of the CPR, the historic Swiss Guides and their families (Credit: Golden Museum)Back in Golden, my ski gear clammy from a long day of touring the pass, I sought out the Golden Museum to learn more about the guides. Inside the Quonset hut-style building, past the early First Nations exhibits, an alcove displayed antiquated climbing gear and grainy photos of men draped in ropes and standing on improbable perches in vast landscapes. Their guides, though, were conspicuously absent. It sparked my need for tangible stories about these people, for the beating heart of this legacy.Which is how I found Rudi Gertsch. Known around the region as the godfather of heli-skiing, he founded Purcell Heliskiing in 1974 as the next generation of Swiss guides to put down roots and exert undeniable influence here, and was the first to bring ski tourists to Golden. Before this, Gertsch said, locals had a little ski hill at the Swiss village and another ski hill that they shared with the Swedes in the Blaeberry, a neighbourhood north of town. There were no lifts; people had to walk up the slope on snowshoes carrying their skis. The first lifts in Golden weren’t installed until 1986 on Whitetooth Ski Hill.The gritty railroad town of Golden, BC, is the gateway to Rogers Pass (Credit: Tourism Golden)Gertsch grew up in a mountain-guiding family in Switzerland; his father had considered coming out to Golden after World War One, when CPR was looking for younger guides to join the first generation. “My dad was quite interested – it’s always interesting for any guide where he can still do some first ascents and new climbs somewhere that’s not overdeveloped – but he decided not to,” recalled Gertsch in a Swiss accent that’s been tempered by more than 50 years in Canada. “We talked about Canada and Golden since I was a kid. I was brought up with the idea of it. Then 30 years later, I ended up here.”He’d planned to stay for a year, but his timing was lucky: heli-skiing was just getting started, and this modern access to the deeper parts of Canada’s untamed landscape again presented a fresh frontier. “It was so new and challenging, figuring out how to do this and being out in the mountains with no one around.”Gertsch knew some of the old guides well; Walter and Edouard were still alive when he came out in 1966. “They were like grandfathers, they were very happy to see the next generation of guides coming in,” he said. They told him the stories of the early days, including the harsh realities concealed by the shroud of mountaineering glory.The village of Edelweiss was created in 1912 for the Swiss guides and their families (Credit: Claire Dibble)CPR had told the guides they’d have houses if they brought their families to Canada; but the architect of Edelweiss knew nothing about Swiss design: the chalets lacked insulation; they were built on a hillside that made gardening impossible; and were located outside town and across the tracks. Only a few months of the year were spent guiding; the rest of the time CPR had them shovelling snow off the chalets in Banff, Lake Louise and Rogers Pass, away from their families, for a pittance.CPR knew that once they were here with their families, there was no way they could afford to go back“The First [World] War followed by the Depression followed by the Second [World] War was a tough time for everyone, and they were dealing with a railroad that was more interested in making money for themselves than giving guides a decent wage,” Gertsch said. “CPR knew that once they were here with their families, there was no way they could afford to go back. And they never did.”Gertsch passed many hours with Eduoard, the elderly guide regaling him with tales of the days when the glaciers spread all the way down to the railway. “We always had the highest respect for [the first Swiss guides]. They did some remarkable climbs in those days with nail boots, it’s amazing how they got up there. And in all the years they never had a single accident,” Gertsch marvelled. “They were treating the mountains with a lot of respect. In those days, there was no Search and Rescue, no radios, if something went wrong, they’d be out there by themselves.”The peaks around Rogers Pass are home to some of Canada’s best backcountry skiing (Credit: cfarish/Getty Images)Before I left Golden, I drove across the tracks and up the icy dirt road at the edge of town to get a better look at the Swiss Village. The houses were mostly boarded up, but they were in good condition, even though no one’s lived here in years. I passed a man walking his hounds, who greeted me when I parked my truck. He introduced himself as Ken Hamilton, the owner of the village and its surrounding land. He told me that his wife Maryanne is Walter Feuz’s granddaughter. They lived in the Swiss Village up until five or six years ago, he said, and still come up almost daily to check on things. They plan to finish restoring the houses and rent them out. They’ll be temporary homes for all the skiers and climbers who come to adventure around here, drawn by the same lure of the unbridled Selkirks that’s persisted through more than 100 years.It seems fitting that they’ll stay in the homes of the first men to open those mountains, following their routes, paths and enduring footsteps.Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called ""The Essential List"".
